actions:
  # === RECONNAISSANCE AND ENUMERATION ===
  - title: drupwn - basic enumeration
    desc: |
      Perform a basic discovery scan on the target Drupal website. This command 
      identifies the Drupal core version and checks for the existence of common files. 
      It is the recommended starting point for any Drupal-specific assessment to 
      establish a baseline of the target environment.
    command: "drupwn --mode enum --target {{target}}"

  - title: drupwn - full component enumeration
    desc: |
      Scan for installed modules, themes, and default Drupal files simultaneously. 
      This is essential for identifying third-party components that might have 
      known vulnerabilities. Note that this process can generate significant web 
      traffic depending on the wordlist size and server responsiveness.
    command: "drupwn --mode enum --target {{target}} --modules --themes --dfiles"

  - title: drupwn - user and node discovery
    desc: |
      Attempt to enumerate valid usernames and published nodes/content using a 
      defined numerical range. This helps in mapping out the site's content structure 
      and identifying potential administrative usernames for brute-force attacks. 
      The range parameter defines how many IDs the tool will attempt to probe.
    command: "drupwn --mode enum --target {{target}} --users --nodes --range {{range|1-100}}"

  # === AUTHENTICATION AND STEALTH ===
  - title: drupwn - authenticated enumeration
    desc: |
      Perform enumeration while providing session cookies or basic authentication 
      credentials. This allows the tool to access pages and modules that are 
      restricted to registered users or administrators. Use this when you have 
      obtained credentials to perform a "grey-box" security assessment.
    command: "drupwn --mode enum --target {{target}} --cookies {{cookies}} --bauth {{user:pass}}"

  - title: drupwn - stealthy scan with delays
    desc: |
      Configure the scan with request delays and a custom User-Agent to avoid 
      detection by Web Application Firewalls (WAF) or rate-limiting scripts. 
      Adding a delay ensures the server is not overwhelmed by rapid requests. 
      This is particularly useful when performing assessments against production 
      environments with active monitoring.
    command: "drupwn --mode enum --target {{target}} --delay {{delay|0.5}} --ua {{user_agent|Mozilla/5.0}}"

  - title: drupwn - proxied enumeration
    desc: |
      Route all scanning traffic through a specified HTTP, HTTPS, or SOCKS proxy. 
      This is useful for anonymizing the source of the scan or for pivoting 
      through a compromised host within a network. You can also provide a file 
      containing a list of proxies to rotate through during the scan.
    command: "drupwn --mode enum --target {{target}} --proxy {{proxy_url|http://127.0.0.1:8080}}"

  # === ADVANCED OPERATIONS ===
  - title: drupwn - exploitation mode
    desc: |
      Switch the tool from information gathering to the exploitation phase. 
      In this mode, the tool attempts to leverage known vulnerabilities based 
      on the identified Drupal version and modules. Exercise extreme caution 
      and ensure you have authorization, as exploitation can impact service stability.
    command: "drupwn --mode exploit --target {{target}}"

  - title: drupwn - multi-threaded scan with logging
    desc: |
      Execute an enumeration scan using multiple threads to increase performance 
      and save the output to a log file for later analysis. Increasing the 
      thread count speeds up the process but may cause the target server to 
      become unstable or block the scanning IP. Logging is highly recommended 
      for maintaining an audit trail of the assessment.
    command: "drupwn --mode enum --target {{target}} --thread {{threads|10}} --log"

  - title: drupwn - update local database
    desc: |
      Update the local plugins, themes, and fingerprinting databases used by the tool. 
      Regular updates ensure that the tool can recognize the latest Drupal versions 
      and the newest community modules. This command should be run periodically 
      to maintain the effectiveness of the enumeration engine.
    command: "drupwn --update"
