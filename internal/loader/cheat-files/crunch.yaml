  # === BASIC GENERATION ===
  - title: crunch - basic wordlist generation
    desc: |
      Generates a wordlist based on a specific length range using the default lowercase alphabet.
      The first number is the minimum length and the second is the maximum length.
      This is useful for creating simple brute-force lists when no specific character set is known.
      Be cautious as the file size grows exponentially with the length.
    command: "crunch {{min|1}} {{max|3}}"

  - title: crunch - custom character set
    desc: |
      Create a wordlist using a specific set of characters provided in the command line.
      Crunch will use only the characters you specify to generate all possible combinations within the min/max range.
      The characters should be entered as a single string immediately after the max length.
      This is ideal when you know the target password only contains certain letters or numbers.
    command: "crunch {{min|4}} {{max|4}} {{characters|0123456789ABCDEF}}"

  - title: crunch - output to file
    desc: |
      Saves the generated wordlist to a specified text file instead of printing to the terminal.
      Using the -o flag is the standard way to prepare wordlists for tools like Hashcat or John the Ripper.
      Crunch will provide an estimate of the file size and the number of lines before starting.
      Ensure you have enough disk space as complex wordlists can easily reach several gigabytes.
    command: "crunch {{min|4}} {{max|6}} -o {{output_file|wordlist.txt}}"

  # === ADVANCED CHARACTER SETS ===
  - title: crunch - using predefined charset files
    desc: |
      Utilizes the standard charset.lst file included with crunch to select specific character groups.
      Common groups include 'mixalpha-numeric', 'numeric', or 'unicode-upper'.
      The path to charset.lst is usually /usr/share/crunch/charset.lst on Kali Linux.
      This method is more efficient than manually typing out long character strings.
    command: "crunch {{min|8}} {{max|8}} -f {{charset_file|/usr/share/crunch/charset.lst}} {{charset_name|mixalpha-numeric}}"

  # === PATTERN BASED GENERATION ===
  - title: crunch - pattern matching (masks)
    desc: |
      Generates words matching a specific pattern using the -t flag.
      Placeholders include @ (lowercase), , (uppercase), % (numbers), and ^ (symbols).
      This is extremely powerful for targeted attacks where part of the password (like a year or a name) is known.
      Any other characters in the pattern will be treated as literal constants.
    command: "crunch {{length|6}} {{length|6}} -t {{pattern|@@202%}} -o {{output_file|pattern_list.txt}}"

  - title: crunch - literal character escape in patterns
    desc: |
      Allows you to use the placeholder characters (@, , % ^) as literals in a pattern.
      The -l flag tells crunch which character in the -t pattern should be treated as a literal instead of a placeholder.
      This is necessary if the target password actually contains a symbol like '%' or '@'.
      Specify the exact character from the pattern that should not be interpreted as a mask.
    command: "crunch {{length|5}} {{length|5}} -t {{pattern|pass%}}"

  # === PERMUTATIONS AND COMBINATIONS ===
  - title: crunch - permutation of specific words
    desc: |
      Generates a wordlist by shuffling the order of specific words or characters provided.
      The -p flag ignores the min/max length parameters and instead focuses on permutations.
      This is useful for "social engineering" wordlists where you combine known keywords like pet names or birthdays.
      Crunch will generate every possible order for the strings you provide.
    command: "crunch 1 1 -p {{word1}} {{word2}} {{word3}}"

  # === FILE AND RESOURCE MANAGEMENT ===
  - title: crunch - split wordlist by size
    desc: |
      Automatically splits the generated wordlist into multiple files based on size.
      The -b flag accepts parameters like 'kb', 'mb', or 'gb' to define the maximum size of each segment.
      The output filename must be set to 'START' or another placeholder to enable auto-numbering.
      This is helpful when dealing with file system limitations or when transferring lists between machines.
    command: "crunch {{min|4}} {{max|8}} -b {{size|20mb}} -o START"

  - title: crunch - split wordlist by line count
    desc: |
      Divides the output into multiple files containing a specific number of lines each.
      Use the -c flag followed by the number of lines per file.
      Similar to the -b flag, the output filename should be specified as 'START'.
      This is useful for parallelizing brute-force attacks across multiple instances of a tool.
    command: "crunch {{min|5}} {{max|5}} -c {{line_count|1000}} -o START"

  - title: crunch - compressed wordlist generation
    desc: |
      Compresses the output wordlist on the fly using gzip, bzip2, or lzma.
      The -z flag followed by the compression type (e.g., gzip) significantly reduces disk space usage.
      Many modern cracking tools can read compressed wordlists directly without manual extraction.
      This is highly recommended for massive wordlists that would otherwise exceed storage limits.
    command: "crunch {{min|1}} {{max|10}} -o {{file|list.txt}} -z {{compression|gzip}}"

  - title: crunch - resume interrupted generation
    desc: |
      Resumes a wordlist generation process from a specific starting string.
      The -s flag allows you to specify the exact word where crunch should begin.
      This is a lifesaver if your system crashed or you needed to stop a long-running generation task.
      Make sure the min/max and character set parameters match the original command.
    command: "crunch {{min|5}} {{max|5}} -s {{start_string|abc12}}"
