# === BASIC DECOMPRESSION ===
 - title: gunzip - basic decompression
   desc: |
     Decompress a gzip file and replace it with the uncompressed version. This is the 
     standard use case when you want to extract a single file for immediate use. 
     By default, the original .gz file is deleted after successful extraction to save 
     disk space.
   command: "gunzip {{file_name}}"

 - title: gunzip - decompress and keep original
   desc: |
     Use the keep flag to prevent the tool from deleting the source archive after extraction. 
     This is useful when you need to maintain a backup or share the compressed file 
     later with other users. It ensures that both the original .gz archive and the 
     newly extracted file exist on the storage.
   command: "gunzip -k {{file_name}}"

 - title: gunzip - verbose decompression
   desc: |
     Extract a file while displaying the name and percentage reduction for each file processed. 
     This provides visual feedback during the extraction process, which is helpful for 
     tracking progress on large files. It allows the user to see exactly what is 
     happening in real-time.
   command: "gunzip -v {{file_name}}"

# === INSPECTION AND TESTING ===
 - title: gunzip - list compressed file info
   desc: |
     Display detailed information about the compressed file without actually extracting it. 
     The output includes the compressed size, uncompressed size, compression ratio, 
     and the original file name. This is a safe way to inspect a file's contents 
     before committing to a full decompression.
   command: "gunzip -l {{file_name}}"

 - title: gunzip - test file integrity
   desc: |
     Check the validity of a compressed file to ensure it has not been corrupted during 
     transfer or storage. This command performs a trial decompression and verifies the 
     internal checksums of the gzip archive. It does not produce any output files, 
     making it ideal for verifying large downloads or backups.
   command: "gunzip -t {{file_name}}"

# === ADVANCED OPERATIONS ===
 - title: gunzip - decompress to stdout
   desc: |
     Extract the contents of a gzip file directly to the terminal or redirect it to a pipe. 
     This allows you to process the data with other tools like grep, awk, or sed without 
     writing the full file to disk first. The original compressed file remains 
     untouched when using this option.
   command: "gunzip -c {{file_name}}"

 - title: gunzip - recursive decompression
   desc: |
     Traverse a directory structure and automatically decompress every .gz file found 
     within it and its subdirectories. This is highly efficient for bulk processing 
     log files or large datasets spread across multiple folders. Note that this will 
     replace all .gz files with uncompressed versions unless combined with other flags.
   command: "gunzip -r {{directory_path}}"

 - title: gunzip - force overwrite
   desc: |
     Overwrite existing files in the destination without prompting the user for confirmation. 
     This is essential for automated scripts or batch jobs where user interaction is 
     not possible. It also allows decompressing files that have multiple hard links 
     or files that do not follow standard naming conventions.
   command: "gunzip -f {{file_name}}"

 - title: gunzip - specify custom suffix
   desc: |
     Decompress files that use a non-standard suffix instead of the default .gz extension. 
     Use this when working with specialized backup systems or custom applications 
     that rename compressed files for organizational purposes. It allows the tool to 
     recognize and process these specific files correctly.
   command: "gunzip -S {{suffix|.ext}} {{file_name}}"

 - title: gunzip - restore original name and timestamp
   desc: |
     Restore the original file name and time stamp if they were saved within the 
     compressed file header. This is the default behavior, but explicitly setting it 
     ensures that file metadata is preserved during the extraction process. It is 
     useful for maintaining historical accuracy of logs or source code files.
   command: "gunzip -N {{file_name}}"
