  # === BASIC USAGE ===
  - title: bruteforce-luks - basic brute force
    desc: |
      Performs a brute-force attack on a LUKS-encrypted volume within a specified length range. 
      Use this when the password length is known or bounded to a small range to avoid excessive computation time. 
      This method generates passwords on the fly using the default alphanumeric character set.
    command: "bruteforce-luks -l {{min_length|1}} -m {{max_length|6}} {{volume_path}}"

  - title: bruteforce-luks - wordlist attack
    desc: |
      Attempts to decrypt the LUKS volume using passwords provided in an external text file. 
      This is generally much faster and more efficient than brute-forcing if you have a high-quality dictionary or leaked password list. 
      Each line in the specified file is treated as a single password candidate for the decryption attempt.
    command: "bruteforce-luks -f {{wordlist_path}} {{volume_path}}"

  # === OPTIMIZATION AND PERFORMANCE ===
  - title: bruteforce-luks - multi-threaded performance
    desc: |
      Increases the speed of the attack by utilizing multiple CPU cores simultaneously. 
      Use this option on modern hardware to significantly reduce the time required to process password candidates. 
      Ensure the number of threads does not exceed your hardware capabilities to maintain system stability during the process.
    command: "bruteforce-luks -t {{thread_count|4}} {{volume_path}}"

  - title: bruteforce-luks - verbose progress reporting
    desc: |
      Prints progress information to the console at a regular time interval. 
      This is useful for monitoring the current status and speed of the attack, ensuring the process has not stalled. 
      The interval is defined in seconds, allowing you to control how often the terminal updates.
    command: "bruteforce-luks -v {{seconds|5}} {{volume_path}}"

  # === TARGETED SEARCH ===
  - title: bruteforce-luks - custom character set
    desc: |
      Defines a specific set of characters to be used during the brute-force generation process. 
      Use this when you know the password only contains certain types of characters, such as numeric digits or lowercase letters. 
      Limiting the charset prevents the tool from wasting time on irrelevant character combinations and speeds up the search.
    command: "bruteforce-luks -s {{charset|0123456789}} {{volume_path}}"

  - title: bruteforce-luks - prefix and suffix attack
    desc: |
      Targets passwords where parts of the string are already known, such as a common company prefix or a year-based suffix. 
      This drastically reduces the search space and time required for a successful crack by only brute-forcing the middle section. 
      It is particularly useful in scenarios where partial password patterns or corporate naming conventions are identified.
    command: "bruteforce-luks -b {{prefix|pass}} -e {{suffix|2023}} {{volume_path}}"

  # === SESSION MANAGEMENT ===
  - title: bruteforce-luks - save and resume session
    desc: |
      Saves the current progress of the attack to a file so it can be resumed later if the process is interrupted. 
      This is essential for long-running brute-force tasks that might span several days or require system reboots. 
      The state file is updated approximately every minute, ensuring that minimal progress is lost in the event of a crash.
    command: "bruteforce-luks -w {{state_file|session.state}} {{volume_path}}"
