# === SEARCH AND DISCOVERY ===
 - title: brew - search for packages
   desc: |
     This command allows you to search for available formulas (CLI tools) and casks (GUI apps) in the Homebrew repository.
     It accepts plain text or regular expressions to filter the results.
     Use this when you are unsure of the exact name of a package you wish to install.
   command: "brew search {{query|wget}}"

 - title: brew - display package information
   desc: |
     Use this command to retrieve detailed metadata about a specific formula or cask.
     It provides information such as the current version, dependencies, conflicts, and the official project URL.
     This is helpful for verifying the requirements of a tool before committing to an installation.
   command: "brew info {{formula_or_cask|nmap}}"

# === INSTALLATION AND REMOVAL ===
 - title: brew - install a package
   desc: |
     This is the primary command for installing new software through Homebrew.
     It downloads the source or pre-compiled "bottle," handles dependencies automatically, and links binaries to your path.
     Note that some installations may require sudo privileges for post-install scripts, though Homebrew itself runs as a standard user.
   command: "brew install {{formula_or_cask|git}}"

 - title: brew - uninstall a package
   desc: |
     This command removes an installed formula or cask from your system.
     It deletes the binaries and associated symlinks created during the installation process.
     Use this to clean up tools you no longer need and free up space in the Homebrew cellar.
   command: "brew uninstall {{formula_or_cask|wget}}"

 - title: brew - list installed packages
   desc: |
     This command displays a list of all formulas and casks currently installed on your local system.
     It is useful for auditing your environment or checking if a specific tool is already present.
     Running this without arguments lists everything, but you can also provide a name to check a specific package.
   command: "brew list"

# === MAINTENANCE AND UPDATES ===
 - title: brew - update homebrew
   desc: |
     Running this command updates Homebrew itself along with the local list of available formulas.
     It does not update your installed software, but it ensures you have the latest definitions from the GitHub repositories.
     It is recommended to run this command before installing new tools or performing upgrades.
   command: "brew update"

 - title: brew - upgrade installed packages
   desc: |
     This command updates all of your installed formulas and casks to their latest available versions.
     If a specific package name is provided, only that tool will be upgraded.
     This is the standard way to keep your command-line environment and applications secure and up to date.
   command: "brew upgrade {{formula_or_cask}}"

 - title: brew - check for outdated packages
   desc: |
     This command identifies which of your installed packages have newer versions available in the repository.
     It provides a concise list of what can be upgraded without actually performing the upgrade process.
     Use this for a quick status check of your system's software health.
   command: "brew outdated"

 - title: brew - cleanup old versions
   desc: |
     Homebrew often keeps old versions of packages and temporary download files, which can consume significant disk space.
     This command removes outdated lock files and stale downloads for all formulas and casks.
     It is a safe way to reclaim storage space without affecting your current software installations.
   command: "brew cleanup"

# === TROUBLESHOOTING ===
 - title: brew - check system health
   desc: |
     The doctor command performs a diagnostic check of your system to find common configuration issues.
     It identifies problems like broken symlinks, unlinked kegs, and conflicting software in your path.
     If you encounter errors during installation or updates, this should be your first troubleshooting step.
   command: "brew doctor"

 - title: brew - show configuration
   desc: |
     This command outputs the current configuration of your Homebrew installation.
     It includes environment variables, paths to the cellar and prefix, and details about your operating system.
     This information is highly valuable when debugging issues or reporting bugs to the Homebrew maintainers.
   command: "brew config"
