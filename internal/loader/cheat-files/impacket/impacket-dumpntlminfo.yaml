  # === BASIC ENUMERATION ===
  - title: impacket-DumpNTLMInfo - Basic SMB Information Gathering
    desc: |
      This command performs an NTLM handshake over the SMB protocol to retrieve target system information. 
      It is highly effective for identifying the internal domain name, DNS hostname, and OS version without providing valid credentials. 
      Security professionals use this as an initial reconnaissance step to map the target's network environment and identity.
    command: "impacket-DumpNTLMInfo {{target}}"

  - title: impacket-DumpNTLMInfo - RPC Protocol Enumeration
    desc: |
      This command targets the RPC service, which typically resides on port 135, to leak system details. 
      It is a vital alternative when SMB (port 445) is blocked or filtered by network firewalls. 
      By initiating an RPC bind, the tool forces an NTLM challenge that contains the same metadata as an SMB handshake.
    command: "impacket-DumpNTLMInfo -protocol RPC -port {{port|135}} {{target}}"

  # === ADVANCED TARGETING ===
  - title: impacket-DumpNTLMInfo - Specify Target IP for NetBIOS Resolution
    desc: |
      Use this command when the target is specified by a NetBIOS name that your local machine cannot resolve. 
      The `-target-ip` flag forces the tool to connect to a specific network address while maintaining the logical target name. 
      This is particularly useful in internal pentests where DNS resolution is inconsistent or multi-homed systems are involved.
    command: "impacket-DumpNTLMInfo -target-ip {{target_ip}} {{target_name}}"

  - title: impacket-DumpNTLMInfo - Custom Port Enumeration
    desc: |
      This command allows the user to specify a non-standard destination port for the NTLM information leak attempt. 
      It is useful in environments where services like SMB are proxied, port-forwarded, or hosted on non-default listener ports. 
      Ensuring the correct port is specified allows the tool to successfully initiate the handshake required for data extraction.
    command: "impacket-DumpNTLMInfo -port {{port}} {{target}}"

  # === TROUBLESHOOTING & LOGGING ===
  - title: impacket-DumpNTLMInfo - Debug Mode with Timestamps
    desc: |
      Enables verbose debug output and prepends timestamps to every logging entry for precise analysis. 
      This mode is essential for troubleshooting failed connections or understanding packet-level NTLM SSP errors. 
      Use this when the target does not return information to determine if the issue is network-related or protocol-specific.
    command: "impacket-DumpNTLMInfo -debug -ts {{target}}"
