  # === BASIC CONNECTIVITY ===
  - title: impacket-ping - Basic ICMP echo request
    desc: |
      Sends a standard ICMP Echo Request from a specified source IP to a destination IP.
      This tool is part of the Impacket library and is used to verify network reachability between two points.
      It is particularly useful for testing raw socket communication and ensuring that the Impacket framework can correctly craft and receive ICMP packets on the current system.
    command: "impacket-ping {{src_ip}} {{dst_ip}}"

  # === NETWORK TROUBLESHOOTING ===
  - title: impacket-ping - Source-specific connectivity test
    desc: |
      Verifies if a specific source address on the local machine can communicate with a target host.
      This is highly effective when working with multiple network interfaces or virtual private networks (VPNs) to ensure traffic is routed through the correct path.
      Users should ensure they have the necessary privileges (usually root/sudo) to create raw sockets required for this operation.
    command: "impacket-ping {{local_interface_ip}} {{target_ip}}"

  # === RECONNAISSANCE & ENUMERATION ===
  - title: impacket-ping - Active host discovery
    desc: |
      Checks if a remote target is active by requesting an ICMP Echo Reply.
      In a penetration testing scenario, this serves as a basic reconnaissance step to map out live hosts within a subnet.
      Be aware that many modern firewalls and EDR solutions may block or rate-limit ICMP traffic, potentially leading to false negatives.
    command: "impacket-ping {{gateway_ip}} {{remote_host_ip}}"

  # === SEGMENTATION TESTING ===
  - title: impacket-ping - Network boundary validation
    desc: |
      Tests the isolation between different network segments by attempting to ping across boundaries.
      This command helps security auditors verify if firewall rules are correctly preventing or allowing ICMP traffic between sensitive zones.
      If the command receives a reply, it indicates that ICMP traffic is permitted between the specified source and destination IPs.
    command: "impacket-ping {{internal_source_ip}} {{dmz_target_ip}}"
