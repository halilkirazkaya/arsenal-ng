# === BASIC ENUMERATION ===

 - title: impacket-getArch - basic target scan
   desc: |
     Identifies the operating system architecture of a single remote target system.
     This tool is highly effective for determining if a target is running a 32-bit or 64-bit version of Windows.
     Knowing the architecture is a critical step before deploying exploits or specific post-exploitation binaries.
     It typically communicates over SMB and RPC ports to gather this information.
   command: "impacket-getArch -target {{target}}"

 - title: impacket-getArch - scan multiple targets from file
   desc: |
     Performs architecture enumeration against a list of targets specified in a text file.
     The input file should contain one target IP address or hostname per line.
     This is ideal for large-scale internal network scanning to map out the infrastructure.
     It helps in categorizing systems for mass exploitation or patch management analysis.
   command: "impacket-getArch -targets {{targets_file}}"

# === ADVANCED CONFIGURATION ===

 - title: impacket-getArch - scan with custom timeout
   desc: |
     Adjusts the socket timeout duration for the connection attempt to the target.
     The default timeout is 2 seconds, which may be insufficient for high-latency or congested networks.
     Increasing this value helps ensure the tool does not exit prematurely when scanning slow-responding systems.
     Use this setting if you are encountering connection reset or timeout errors in unstable environments.
   command: "impacket-getArch -target {{target}} -timeout {{timeout|5}}"

 - title: impacket-getArch - scan with debug output
   desc: |
     Enables verbose debug logging for the entire execution process.
     This provides deep visibility into the underlying protocol exchanges and Impacket library calls.
     It is extremely useful for troubleshooting connectivity issues or protocol-level errors.
     Use this when the tool fails to return an architecture despite the target being alive.
   command: "impacket-getArch -target {{target}} -debug"

 - title: impacket-getArch - scan with timestamps
   desc: |
     Adds a precise timestamp to every line generated in the tool's logging output.
     This feature is essential for maintaining accurate audit trails during a professional engagement.
     It allows consultants to correlate their activities with target system logs or network traffic captures.
     It is recommended to use this flag whenever output is being redirected to a log file for reporting.
   command: "impacket-getArch -target {{target}} -ts"
