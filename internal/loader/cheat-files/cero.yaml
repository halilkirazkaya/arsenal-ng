# === BASIC USAGE ===
 - title: cero - basic domain certificate scraping
   desc: |
     Scrape TLS certificate information from a single domain to discover associated hostnames.
     This command retrieves Subject Alternative Names (SANs) and Common Names (CN) from the target's certificate.
     It is a highly efficient way to find subdomains that might not be listed in public DNS records.
   command: "cero {{target}}"

 - title: cero - output valid domain names only
   desc: |
     Filter the output to display only valid domain names, stripping out IPs and wildcards.
     This is particularly useful when you want to pipe the output directly into other tools like httpx or subfinder.
     Using the -d flag ensures your reconnaissance pipeline remains clean of non-routable or junk strings.
   command: "cero -d {{target}}"

 - title: cero - verbose output with detailed results
   desc: |
     Enable verbose mode to see which address produced which set of domain results.
     In this mode, cero outputs results in the format 'addr -- [result list]' and sends errors to stderr.
     This is helpful for debugging connection issues or verifying exactly which IP provided a specific certificate.
   command: "cero -v {{target}}"

# === NETWORK & RANGE SCANNING ===
 - title: cero - scan network CIDR range
   desc: |
     Perform certificate scraping across an entire IPv4 or IPv6 CIDR block.
     Cero will attempt to connect to every IP in the range and extract hostname information from any TLS services found.
     This is an excellent technique for mapping out the infrastructure of an organization based on their IP space.
   command: "cero {{cidr_range}}"

 - title: cero - scan with custom TLS ports
   desc: |
     Specify a custom list of ports to check for TLS certificates beyond the default port 443.
     You can provide a comma-separated list of ports to scan multiple common SSL/TLS services like 8443, 9443, or 10443.
     This is essential for finding administrative panels or hidden web services running on non-standard ports.
   command: "cero -p {{ports|443,8443,10443}} {{target}}"

 - title: cero - scan IPv6 target with specific port
   desc: |
     Target a specific IPv6 address and port for certificate information.
     While cero can often handle bare IPv6 addresses, using square brackets is the safest way to prevent ambiguity when adding a port.
     This command is useful for targeted reconnaissance on modern network stacks.
   command: "cero [{{ipv6_address}}]:{{port|443}}"

# === PERFORMANCE & BULK OPERATIONS ===
 - title: cero - bulk scanning with high concurrency
   desc: |
     Process a large list of targets from a file or another tool's output using multiple threads.
     The concurrency level determines how many TLS connections are attempted simultaneously, with a default of 100.
     Increasing this value can significantly speed up mass scanning but may require more system resources and bandwidth.
   command: "cat {{input_file}} | cero -c {{concurrency|1000}}"

 - title: cero - adjust TLS connection timeout
   desc: |
     Set a custom timeout for TLS handshake attempts in seconds.
     The default timeout is 4 seconds; increasing it may help capture results from slow or high-latency servers.
     Decreasing the timeout can make mass scans faster but might result in missing certificates from slower endpoints.
   command: "cero -t {{timeout_seconds|10}} {{target}}"

# === PIPELINE INTEGRATION ===
 - title: cero - full mass-scraping pipeline
   desc: |
     Execute a comprehensive scan across a range of ports and a network block with high concurrency.
     This example demonstrates how to combine multiple flags for an intensive reconnaissance phase.
     Results can be redirected to a file, while errors are suppressed by redirecting stderr to /dev/null.
   command: "cero -p {{ports|443,8443}} -c {{concurrency|500}} -d {{target_range}} 2>/dev/null > {{output_file|results.txt}}"
