actions:
  # === BASIC SCANNING ===
  - title: dirb - default scan
    desc: |
      Performs a standard recursive scan on the target URL using the default wordlist provided by DIRB.
      This is the most common starting point for web directory enumeration to identify hidden paths.
      The tool will automatically crawl into any directories it discovers during the process.
      Note that this can generate significant traffic depending on the size of the target and depth.
    command: "dirb {{url}}"

  - title: dirb - scan with custom wordlist
    desc: |
      Uses a specific wordlist file provided by the user to perform the discovery process.
      This is highly effective when targeting specific technologies or when using comprehensive lists like those in SecLists.
      Ensure the path to the wordlist is accessible and correctly formatted on your local system.
      Custom wordlists often yield better results than generic ones for specific CMS or application frameworks.
    command: "dirb {{url}} {{wordlist|/usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt}}"

  - title: dirb - search with specific extensions
    desc: |
      Appends specific file extensions to every word in the dictionary during the scanning process.
      This is critical for finding backend scripts like .php, configuration files like .conf, or backup files like .bak.
      Multiple extensions should be provided as a comma-separated list without spaces.
      This action significantly increases the number of requests sent to the server.
    command: "dirb {{url}} -X {{extensions|.php,.txt,.config}}"

  # === SCAN CONTROL & OPTIMIZATION ===
  - title: dirb - disable recursive scanning
    desc: |
      Prevents the tool from automatically entering and scanning subdirectories it finds.
      Use this when you only want to audit the root level of a web application to save time and resources.
      It is particularly useful for a quick initial reconnaissance phase before performing deeper dives.
      This option helps in keeping the scope of the scan strictly limited to the base URL provided.
    command: "dirb {{url}} -r"

  - title: dirb - ignore specific HTTP response codes
    desc: |
      Configures the scanner to ignore responses that return a specific HTTP status code.
      This is useful for filtering out false positives or uninteresting results like 403 Forbidden or 302 Redirects.
      By ignoring certain codes, you can focus purely on successful hits or specific error types.
      Use this flag followed by the numeric HTTP code you wish to exclude from the output.
    command: "dirb {{url}} -N {{status_code|403}}"

  - title: dirb - set scan delay
    desc: |
      Introduces a delay in milliseconds between each request sent to the target web server.
      This is a vital feature for evading rate-limiting mechanisms or simple Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS).
      It also helps in reducing the load on the target server to prevent accidental Denial of Service (DoS).
      Higher values make the scan much slower but significantly stealthier and safer for fragile environments.
    command: "dirb {{url}} -z {{delay_ms|100}}"

  # === AUTHENTICATION & HEADERS ===
  - title: dirb - scan with basic authentication
    desc: |
      Provides credentials to access areas of a website protected by HTTP Basic Authentication.
      This allows the tool to enumerate files and directories that are hidden behind a login prompt.
      The credentials must be provided in the 'username:password' format.
      Be cautious as multiple failed attempts might trigger account lockout policies on some systems.
    command: "dirb {{url}} -u {{credentials|admin:password123}}"

  - title: dirb - scan with custom cookie
    desc: |
      Injects a custom cookie into every HTTP request made by the DIRB scanner.
      This is essential for scanning areas of a web application that require an active session or specific state.
      It can be used to bypass cookie-based security filters or to scan as a specific authenticated user.
      Ensure the cookie string is correctly formatted according to HTTP standards.
    command: "dirb {{url}} -c {{cookie_string|'session_id=123456'}}"

  - title: dirb - scan with custom user-agent
    desc: |
      Overrides the default DIRB user-agent string with a custom one provided by the user.
      Many web application firewalls (WAFs) block the default DIRB user-agent to prevent automated scanning.
      Using a realistic browser string can help bypass these basic signature-based security blocks.
      It is a recommended practice for more professional and less conspicuous penetration testing.
    command: "dirb {{url}} -a {{user_agent|'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64)'}}"

  # === PROXY & OUTPUT ===
  - title: dirb - scan through proxy
    desc: |
      Routes all traffic through a specified HTTP proxy server before it reaches the target.
      This is commonly used to route traffic through Burp Suite for manual inspection or through SOCKS proxies for anonymity.
      The proxy should be specified in the 'host:port' format.
      This is also useful for bypassing IP-based restrictions if the proxy is in a trusted network.
    command: "dirb {{url}} -p {{proxy_address|127.0.0.1:8080}}"

  - title: dirb - save output to file
    desc: |
      Writes the entire output of the scan session to a specified file on the local file system.
      This is critical for documentation, reporting, and further analysis using grep or other parsing tools.
      The file will contain all the discovered URLs, their status codes, and size information.
      It ensures that no data is lost when the terminal buffer is cleared or the session ends.
    command: "dirb {{url}} -o {{output_file|scan_results.txt}}"

  # === RELATED UTILITIES ===
  - title: dirb - generate custom dictionary (dirb-gendict)
    desc: |
      Uses the dirb-gendict utility to create a wordlist based on a specific incremental pattern.
      This is useful for brute-forcing URL structures that follow a predictable naming convention, such as 'user_1', 'user_2'.
      The 'X' character in the pattern is replaced by the incremental value during generation.
      You can choose between numeric, character, or alphanumeric types for the replacement.
    command: "dirb-gendict -{{type|n}} {{pattern|vulnerary_X}}"

  - title: dirb - extract words from HTML (html2dic)
    desc: |
      Extracts all unique words from an HTML file to generate a specialized dictionary.
      This is an excellent way to build a context-specific wordlist based on the target website's own content.
      The output is sent to stdout, which can be redirected into a file for use with DIRB later.
      It helps in finding hidden files that might share names with existing site terminology.
    command: "html2dic {{html_file}} > {{output_wordlist|custom_dic.txt}}"
