  # === TARGETING & BASIC SCANS ===
  - title: nuclei - scan single target
    desc: |
      Runs a standard vulnerability scan against a single target URL or host.
      This command uses the default template directory to identify misconfigurations and vulnerabilities.
      It is the most common entry point for a quick security assessment of a specific web application.
    command: "nuclei -u {{target}}"

  - title: nuclei - scan list of targets
    desc: |
      Executes templates against multiple targets provided in a line-separated text file.
      This is ideal for large-scale infrastructure scanning or bug bounty automation.
      Ensure the file contains valid URLs or IP addresses to avoid resolution errors.
    command: "nuclei -l {{targets_file|hosts.txt}}"

  - title: nuclei - automatic scan with technology detection
    desc: |
      Utilizes Wappalyzer-based technology detection to automatically map relevant templates to the target.
      This mode reduces scan time by only running templates that match the identified tech stack (e.g., WordPress, Nginx).
      It is highly recommended for efficient scanning without manually specifying template tags.
    command: "nuclei -u {{target}} -as"

  # === TEMPLATE FILTERING & SELECTION ===
  - title: nuclei - scan by specific tags
    desc: |
      Filters and runs only the templates that match specific tags like cve, exposure, or default-login.
      This allows for surgical scanning when looking for specific classes of vulnerabilities.
      Multiple tags can be provided as a comma-separated list to broaden the scope.
    command: "nuclei -u {{target}} -tags {{tags|cve,config,exposure}}"

  - title: nuclei - scan by severity level
    desc: |
      Runs templates filtered by their severity rating, such as critical, high, or medium.
      This is extremely useful during time-sensitive engagements to prioritize the most impactful findings first.
      Use this to ignore informational or low-severity findings that might clutter your report.
    command: "nuclei -u {{target}} -severity {{severity|critical,high}}"

  - title: nuclei - run new templates only
    desc: |
      Executes only the templates that were added in the latest release of the nuclei-templates repository.
      This is a great way to stay updated with the latest 1-day vulnerabilities and zero-day disclosures.
      It ensures you are checking for the most recent threats without re-scanning old vulnerabilities.
    command: "nuclei -u {{target}} -nt"

  - title: nuclei - run specific template directory
    desc: |
      Targets a specific category of vulnerabilities by pointing to a specific template folder.
      For example, you can point to 'http/cves/' to only check for known CVEs.
      This helps in focusing the scan on a specific protocol or vulnerability type.
    command: "nuclei -u {{target}} -t {{template_path|http/vulnerabilities/}}"

  # === ADVANCED SCANNING MODES ===
  - title: nuclei - headless browser scanning
    desc: |
      Enables templates that require a headless browser to render JavaScript-heavy applications.
      This is necessary for modern Single Page Applications (SPAs) where standard HTTP requests are insufficient.
      Note that this requires more system resources and may be slower than standard scanning.
    command: "nuclei -u {{target}} -headless"

  - title: nuclei - DAST / Fuzzing mode
    desc: |
      Enables Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) templates focused on parameter fuzzing.
      This mode attempts to find vulnerabilities like XSS, SQLi, and SSRF by manipulating input fields.
      Use this with caution as it can be intrusive and might generate a significant amount of traffic.
    command: "nuclei -u {{target}} -dast"

  - title: nuclei - passive scanning
    desc: |
      Enables passive HTTP response processing mode, which does not send new requests for every template.
      It analyzes the responses received from initial requests to identify vulnerabilities or exposures.
      This is much quieter and less intrusive than active scanning, making it suitable for stealthy reconnaissance.
    command: "nuclei -u {{target}} -passive"

  # === PERFORMANCE & EVASION ===
  - title: nuclei - rate limiting and concurrency
    desc: |
      Controls the speed of the scan by setting the maximum number of requests per second.
      Adjusting rate limits is crucial to avoid triggering WAF blocks or crashing fragile legacy services.
      'rl' sets requests per second, while 'c' sets the number of templates to run in parallel.
    command: "nuclei -u {{target}} -rl {{rate|50}} -c {{concurrency|25}}"

  - title: nuclei - custom headers and cookies
    desc: |
      Injects custom HTTP headers or authentication cookies into every request sent by Nuclei.
      This is essential for scanning protected areas of an application that require an active session.
      Format the header as 'Header-Name: value' and use multiple flags for multiple headers.
    command: "nuclei -u {{target}} -H \"{{header|Cookie: session=12345}}\""

  - title: nuclei - proxy integration
    desc: |
      Routes all outgoing traffic through a specified HTTP or SOCKS5 proxy.
      This can be used to tunnel traffic through Burp Suite for deeper analysis or to mask the scanner's IP address.
      It is also useful for reaching internal targets through a pivot host.
    command: "nuclei -u {{target}} -proxy {{proxy_url|http://127.0.0.1:8080}}"

  # === OSINT & EXTERNAL ENGINES ===
  - title: nuclei - uncover engine (Shodan/Censys)
    desc: |
      Integrates with 'Uncover' to pull targets directly from search engines like Shodan, Censys, or Fofa.
      This allows you to scan the entire internet for specific patterns or vulnerabilities based on a query.
      You must have the respective API keys configured in your environment or config file.
    command: "nuclei -uc -uq \"{{query|app:'Apache}}\" -ue {{engine|shodan}}"

  # === REPORTING & OUTPUT ===
  - title: nuclei - export results to JSON
    desc: |
      Saves the scan findings into a JSON format for easy integration with other tools or custom scripts.
      JSON output includes detailed metadata about each finding, including request/response pairs if enabled.
      This is the preferred format for automated pipelines and data processing.
    command: "nuclei -u {{target}} -je {{output_file|results.json}}"

  - title: nuclei - export results to Markdown
    desc: |
      Generates a human-readable report in Markdown format, organized by vulnerability type.
      This is perfect for creating quick documentation or reports for clients and stakeholders.
      The output directory will contain individual files for different findings.
    command: "nuclei -u {{target}} -me {{output_dir|nuclei_report}}"

  - title: nuclei - silent mode with only findings
    desc: |
      Suppresses all banner and progress information, displaying only the actual vulnerabilities found.
      This is useful when piping Nuclei output into other command-line tools like 'notify' or 'grep'.
      It keeps the terminal clean and focuses only on actionable data.
    command: "nuclei -u {{target}} -silent"

  # === MAINTENANCE ===
  - title: nuclei - update templates and tool
    desc: |
      Updates the Nuclei engine and the community-provided templates to the latest version.
      Regular updates are vital because the community adds dozens of new vulnerability templates every week.
      Run this frequently to ensure your scanning capabilities remain current.
    command: "nuclei -ut && nuclei -version"
