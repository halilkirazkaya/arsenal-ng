actions:
  # === BASIC RECONNAISSANCE ===
  - title: autorecon - basic scan of a single target
    desc: |
      Performs a default automated reconnaissance on a single IP address or hostname. 
      This is the most common starting point which initiates port discovery and follows up with service-specific enumeration plugins. 
      It is highly effective for CTF environments and initial penetration testing phases to gather as much information as possible.
    command: "autorecon {{target}}"

  - title: autorecon - scan multiple targets or network range
    desc: |
      Launches reconnaissance against multiple targets defined by space-separated IP addresses or CIDR notation. 
      The tool manages concurrency automatically, allowing you to scan entire subnets efficiently. 
      This is ideal for internal network assessments where you need to identify active services across many hosts simultaneously.
    command: "autorecon {{network_range|10.10.10.0/24}}"

  - title: autorecon - scan targets from a text file
    desc: |
      Reads a list of target IPs or hostnames from a specified file and performs automated enumeration on each. 
      The input file should contain one target per line for the parser to handle them correctly. 
      This approach is preferred when you have a pre-validated scope file from a client or a discovery tool.
    command: "autorecon -t {{target_file|targets.txt}}"

  # === PORT AND PROTOCOL FILTERING ===
  - title: autorecon - scan specific ports and protocols
    desc: |
      Limits the initial port discovery to specific TCP or UDP ports provided in the command. 
      You can use T: for TCP and U: for UDP, or B: for both; for example, T:80,443 or U:161. 
      Restricting ports is useful when you want to save time or focus only on specific services like web or SNMP.
    command: "autorecon {{target}} -p {{ports|T:21,22,80,443,U:53,161}}"

  - title: autorecon - exclude specific plugin tags
    desc: |
      Excludes certain types of scans based on their tags to speed up the process or avoid noisy plugins. 
      For instance, you might want to exclude 'bruteforce' tags if you are worried about account lockouts. 
      This gives you fine-grained control over which automated actions the tool performs on the targets.
    command: "autorecon {{target}} --exclude-tags {{tags|bruteforce,exploit}}"

  # === WEB ENUMERATION CUSTOMIZATION ===
  - title: autorecon - custom directory busting settings
    desc: |
      Overrides the default directory busting configuration, allowing you to choose the tool and wordlist. 
      You can switch between tools like feroxbuster, gobuster, or ffuf and specify relevant file extensions. 
      Using extensions like 'php,aspx,txt' ensures the fuzzer looks for files relevant to the target's technology stack.
    command: "autorecon {{target}} --dirbuster.tool {{tool|feroxbuster}} --dirbuster.wordlist {{wordlist|/usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt}} --dirbuster.ext {{extensions|php,aspx,html,txt}}"

  - title: autorecon - subdomain and virtual host enumeration
    desc: |
      Enables and configures DNS-based enumeration for subdomains and virtual hosts on a specific domain. 
      You must provide the base domain name (e.g., example.com) for the plugins to generate the correct host headers and queries. 
      This is essential for identifying hidden web applications hosted on the same IP address through virtual hosting.
    command: "autorecon {{target}} --subdomain-enum.domain {{domain}} --vhost-enum.hostname {{domain}}"

  # === OUTPUT AND PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT ===
  - title: autorecon - customize output directory and structure
    desc: |
      Defines a specific parent directory for all scan results instead of the default 'results' folder. 
      By using the --single-target flag, you can also prevent the tool from creating target-specific subdirectories. 
      This helps in keeping the workspace organized when you are working on a dedicated machine or a specific project.
    command: "autorecon {{target}} -o {{output_dir|./recon_results}} --single-target"

  - title: autorecon - adjust concurrency and timeouts
    desc: |
      Configures the maximum number of concurrent scans and specific timeouts for targets. 
      Increasing max-scans can speed up large network audits but might overwhelm your local resources or the network. 
      Setting a target-timeout ensures the tool doesn't get stuck on a single unresponsive host for too long.
    command: "autorecon {{targets}} -m {{max_scans|50}} --target-timeout {{timeout_mins|60}}"

  # === ADVANCED CONFIGURATION ===
  - title: autorecon - append custom nmap arguments
    desc: |
      Passes additional custom flags directly to the underlying Nmap process used for port discovery. 
      This is useful for adding advanced flags like --script-args, specific timing templates (-T), or bypass techniques. 
      Be careful not to include flags that conflict with AutoRecon's internal logic, such as output format flags.
    command: "autorecon {{target}} --nmap-append \"{{nmap_flags|-Pn -T4 --min-rate 1000}}\""

  - title: autorecon - global credentials for service scanning
    desc: |
      Provides global username and password wordlists that service plugins will use for basic authentication attempts. 
      Plugins for protocols like SSH, FTP, and SMB will use these lists to check for common or weak credentials. 
      It is recommended to use small, targeted lists to avoid triggering intrusion detection systems or locking accounts.
    command: "autorecon {{target}} --global.username-wordlist {{user_list}} --global.password-wordlist {{pass_list}}"

  - title: autorecon - run through proxychains
    desc: |
      Configures AutoRecon to operate through a proxy, which is vital when pivoting through a compromised host. 
      This flag adjusts internal behaviors to be more compatible with SOCKS proxies used by tools like proxychains. 
      Note that some plugins, especially those using UDP, may still fail due to the inherent limitations of standard proxies.
    command: "autorecon {{target}} --proxychains"
