# === BASIC CONNECTIVITY ===
 - title: fping - ping single target
   desc: |
     Sends a basic ICMP echo request to a single specified target host or IP address.
     This is the fundamental usage of the tool to verify if a specific host is reachable.
     It provides a quick status update on whether the target is alive or unreachable.
     Note that ICMP traffic might be filtered by local or network firewalls.
   command: "fping {{target}}"

 - title: fping - ping multiple targets
   desc: |
     Pings multiple targets simultaneously by listing them as command line arguments.
     This is useful for checking the status of a small group of known servers or workstations.
     Unlike standard ping, fping does not wait for one target to timeout before pinging the next.
     The output will list the status of each target in the order they were provided.
   command: "fping {{target_1}} {{target_2}} {{target_3}}"

 - title: fping - show only alive hosts
   desc: |
     Filters the output to display only the hosts that respond to ICMP echo requests.
     This is particularly useful when scanning large networks to identify active systems quickly.
     It suppresses the "unreachable" messages that normally clutter the terminal output.
     Use this when you need a clean list of active IP addresses for further processing.
   command: "fping -a {{target_network}}"

 - title: fping - show only unreachable hosts
   desc: |
     Filters the output to display only the hosts that did not respond to the ping.
     This command is helpful for identifying gaps in a network range or detecting downed systems.
     It is the inverse of the alive flag and helps focused troubleshooting on unresponsive nodes.
     This can be paired with output redirection to create a list of IP addresses requiring investigation.
   command: "fping -u {{target_network}}"

# === NETWORK ENUMERATION ===
 - title: fping - scan network range using CIDR
   desc: |
     Generates and pings a list of targets based on a specified CIDR network notation.
     This is an efficient way to scan an entire subnet, such as a /24 or /23, for active hosts.
     The -g flag allows the tool to calculate the range of IP addresses automatically.
     Ensure you have permission to scan the network to avoid triggering intrusion detection systems.
   command: "fping -g {{network_cidr|192.168.1.0/24}}"

 - title: fping - scan IP range by start and end
   desc: |
     Pings a specific range of IP addresses by providing the start and end values.
     This method is useful when you only want to scan a specific subset of a larger network.
     It uses the generate flag to fill in the intermediate IP addresses between the two boundaries.
     This is often preferred over CIDR when the target range does not align with standard subnet masks.
   command: "fping -g {{start_ip}} {{end_ip}}"

 - title: fping - reverse DNS lookup
   desc: |
     Performs a reverse DNS lookup for each target IP address and displays the hostname.
     This provides context for the IP addresses discovered, making it easier to identify specific servers.
     The -n flag is used to resolve the names of the IP addresses provided in the target list.
     The speed of this command depends heavily on the responsiveness of the configured DNS server.
   command: "fping -n {{target_network}}"

# === FILE AND INPUT HANDLING ===
 - title: fping - read targets from file
   desc: |
     Reads a list of target IP addresses or hostnames from a specified text file.
     This is the standard approach for scanning specific lists of assets generated by other tools.
     Each target should be listed on a new line within the input file.
     Using a file input is much cleaner than passing hundreds of arguments via the command line.
   command: "fping -f {{input_file|targets.txt}}"

 - title: fping - read targets from stdin
   desc: |
     Accepts a list of targets directly from the standard input (stdin) using the pipe operator.
     This allows you to pipe the output of other tools, like grep or awk, directly into fping.
     The hyphen (-) passed to the -f flag tells fping to look for input from the stream.
     This is a powerful way to chain network discovery tools together in a single command line.
   command: "cat {{input_file}} | fping -f -"

# === PERFORMANCE AND ANALYSIS ===
 - title: fping - count mode with statistics
   desc: |
     Sends a specific number of pings to each target and provides a summary of results.
     The -c flag determines how many packets are sent per host, while -s provides final statistics.
     This is excellent for measuring packet loss and average latency over a period of time.
     The statistics include the number of targets, responses, and the total elapsed time.
   command: "fping -c {{count|4}} -s {{target}}"

 - title: fping - continuous loop mode
   desc: |
     Pings the specified targets indefinitely until the user manually stops the process.
     This is useful for long-term monitoring of a host's availability or testing for intermittent issues.
     The output will continuously update with the latency of each packet returned.
     Use Ctrl+C to terminate the loop and see the final summary of the session.
   command: "fping -l {{target}}"

 - title: fping - customize ping intervals
   desc: |
     Adjusts the timing between sending packets to control the speed and intensity of the scan.
     The -i flag sets the interval between sending pings to different targets, while -p sets the interval for the same target.
     Decreasing these values makes the scan much faster but increases the risk of being blocked or causing congestion.
     Be cautious with low intervals, as some systems might interpret high-speed ICMP as a flood attack.
   command: "fping -i {{interval_ms|10}} -p {{period_ms|500}} {{target_network}}"

 - title: fping - force IPv4 or IPv6
   desc: |
     Restricts the tool to use only a specific version of the Internet Protocol.
     Use -4 to force IPv4 connections or -6 to force IPv6 connections when scanning dual-stack hosts.
     This is helpful for troubleshooting connectivity issues that might be protocol-specific.
     It ensures that the tool doesn't waste time attempting to resolve or ping versions you aren't interested in.
   command: "fping -{{version|4}} {{target}}"
