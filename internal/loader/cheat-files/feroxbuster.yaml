  # === BASIC USAGE ===
  - title: feroxbuster - basic directory scan
    desc: |
      Performs a basic recursive directory discovery scan on the target URL.
      It uses the default wordlist and settings to find unlinked content and directories.
      This is the standard starting point for web reconnaissance to identify hidden paths.
      The tool will automatically recurse into any discovered directories by default.
    command: "feroxbuster -u {{url}}"

  - title: feroxbuster - scan with specific extensions
    desc: |
      Appends a list of file extensions to each entry in the wordlist during the scan.
      This is essential for finding specific server-side scripts, configuration files, or backups.
      You can provide multiple extensions separated by commas or multiple flags.
      Common extensions to check include php, html, bak, config, and txt.
    command: "feroxbuster -u {{url}} -x {{extensions|php,html,txt,bak}}"

  - title: feroxbuster - use custom wordlist
    desc: |
      Specifies a custom wordlist file to be used for the brute-forcing process.
      High-quality wordlists like SecLists improve the chances of finding sensitive endpoints.
      If not specified, feroxbuster uses its built-in default wordlist or the one defined in the config file.
      Ensure the path to the wordlist is correct and accessible by the current user.
    command: "feroxbuster -u {{url}} -w {{wordlist_path|/usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt}}"

  # === PERFORMANCE & RECURSION ===
  - title: feroxbuster - non-recursive scan
    desc: |
      Disables the default recursive behavior, scanning only the provided base URL.
      This is useful when you want to quickly audit a single directory without diving into subfolders.
      It significantly reduces the total scan time and the number of requests sent to the server.
      Use this when the target has many nested levels that are irrelevant to your scope.
    command: "feroxbuster -u {{url}} --no-recursion"

  - title: feroxbuster - high speed scanning
    desc: |
      Increases the number of concurrent threads to accelerate the discovery process.
      The default thread count is 50; increasing it can speed up scans but may overwhelm the target server.
      Use this with caution as it might trigger Rate Limiting or Web Application Firewalls (WAF).
      It is recommended to monitor the server's response time when using high thread counts.
    command: "feroxbuster -u {{url}} -t {{threads|100}}"

  - title: feroxbuster - rate limiting
    desc: |
      Limits the total number of requests sent per second to prevent crashing the target.
      This is vital when scanning fragile legacy systems or environments with strict monitoring.
      Setting a rate limit helps in staying under the radar of automated blocking mechanisms.
      The value is defined as requests per second per directory scan.
    command: "feroxbuster -u {{url}} --rate-limit {{requests_per_second|10}}"

  # === FILTERING RESPONSES ===
  - title: feroxbuster - filter by status codes
    desc: |
      Excludes specific HTTP status codes from the output results.
      This is useful for hiding common but irrelevant responses like 404 (Not Found) or 403 (Forbidden).
      By default, feroxbuster shows all discovered codes unless specified otherwise.
      You can provide a comma-separated list of codes to ignore during the scan.
    command: "feroxbuster -u {{url}} -C {{filter_codes|403,401,500}}"

  - title: feroxbuster - filter by response size
    desc: |
      Filters out responses that have a specific body size in bytes.
      This is extremely helpful for bypassing "Soft 404" pages that return a 200 OK status but identical content.
      You can identify the size of the junk response first and then use this flag to hide it.
      Multiple sizes can be filtered simultaneously to clean up the output.
    command: "feroxbuster -u {{url}} -S {{size_bytes}}"

  - title: feroxbuster - filter similar pages (Soft 404)
    desc: |
      Filters out pages that are dynamically similar to a given URL's response.
      This is the most effective way to handle custom error pages that return 200 status codes.
      Feroxbuster will fetch the provided URL and use its structure to ignore similar results.
      It helps in reducing false positives in modern web applications.
    command: "feroxbuster -u {{url}} --filter-similar-to {{example_url}}"

  # === AUTHENTICATION & HEADERS ===
  - title: feroxbuster - authenticated scan with cookies
    desc: |
      Sends specific session cookies with every request to scan protected areas of the application.
      This allows for the discovery of hidden administrative panels or user-specific directories.
      The format should be a string containing the cookie name and its value.
      Be aware that intensive scanning might trigger account lockout policies if the session expires.
    command: "feroxbuster -u {{url}} -b {{cookie_string|session=abc123xyz}}"

  - title: feroxbuster - custom headers and user-agent
    desc: |
      Sets custom HTTP headers or a specific User-Agent for all outgoing requests.
      Custom headers are often required for API scanning (e.g., Authorization tokens) or bypassing WAFs.
      Using a realistic User-Agent can help blend in with legitimate traffic.
      You can use the --random-agent flag as an alternative for automatic rotation.
    command: "feroxbuster -u {{url}} -H \"{{header_name|Authorization}}: {{header_value}}\" -a \"{{user_agent}}\""

  # === PROXY & INTERCEPTION ===
  - title: feroxbuster - proxy through Burp Suite
    desc: |
      Routes all traffic through a specified proxy, typically Burp Suite or OWASP ZAP.
      The --burp flag is a shortcut that sets the proxy to http://127.0.0.1:8080 and disables TLS validation.
      This allows for detailed manual inspection of interesting requests discovered by the tool.
      Ensure your proxy tool is running and configured to listen on the specified port.
    command: "feroxbuster -u {{url}} --burp"

  - title: feroxbuster - replay proxy for specific codes
    desc: |
      Sends only specific successful responses (like 200 or 302) to a secondary proxy.
      This prevents clogging your Burp Suite history with 404 errors while still capturing valid findings.
      It is a highly efficient way to combine automated discovery with manual analysis.
      The --replay-codes flag defines which status codes should be forwarded.
    command: "feroxbuster -u {{url}} --replay-proxy {{proxy_url|http://127.0.0.1:8080}} --replay-codes {{codes|200,302}} --insecure"

  # === ADVANCED & AUTOMATION ===
  - title: feroxbuster - smart/thorough discovery
    desc: |
      Enables "Thorough" mode which activates several advanced discovery features at once.
      This mode automatically collects new words from responses, looks for backups, and discovers extensions.
      It is more aggressive and time-consuming but provides a much deeper level of enumeration.
      Ideal for comprehensive security assessments where time is not the primary constraint.
    command: "feroxbuster -u {{url}} --thorough"

  - title: feroxbuster - resume a paused scan
    desc: |
      Resumes a previously interrupted scan using a state file generated by feroxbuster.
      State files are created automatically during execution and saved in the current directory.
      This feature is life-saving for long-running scans that were stopped due to network issues or manual intervention.
      Simply point the command to the .state file to pick up exactly where it left off.
    command: "feroxbuster --resume-from {{state_file}}"

  - title: feroxbuster - read targets from STDIN
    desc: |
      Reads a list of URLs from standard input and processes them in parallel.
      This is perfect for piping results from other tools like subfinder, assetfinder, or httpx.
      The --stdin flag tells the tool to ignore the -u requirement and read from the pipe instead.
      This enables powerful automation chains in bug bounty or large-scale internal network scans.
    command: "cat {{targets_file}} | feroxbuster --stdin"

  - title: feroxbuster - save output to file
    desc: |
      Writes the scan results to a specified output file for later reporting or analysis.
      You can also use the --json flag in conjunction with this to save the output in machine-readable format.
      Saving results is critical for documentation during a penetration test or audit.
      The output includes the status code, response size, and the discovered URL.
    command: "feroxbuster -u {{url}} -o {{output_file|results.txt}}"
