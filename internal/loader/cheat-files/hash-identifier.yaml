actions:
  - title: hash-identifier - interactive mode
    desc: |
      Launch the tool in its primary interactive mode to identify hashes manually. 
      This is the standard way to use the tool, allowing you to paste hashes one by one and receive immediate feedback on the likely algorithm. 
      It is highly useful during the enumeration phase of a pentest when you encounter unknown strings in databases or configuration files.
    command: "hash-identifier"

  # === AUTOMATION AND INPUT REDIRECTION ===

  - title: hash-identifier - identify single hash via pipe
    desc: |
      Identify a single hash by piping the string directly into the tool from the command line. 
      This method is efficient for quick checks without manually entering the interactive environment. 
      The tool will process the piped string as if it were typed at the "HASH:" prompt and display the results immediately.
    command: "echo {{hash_string}} | hash-identifier"

  - title: hash-identifier - identify hash from a file
    desc: |
      Read a hash from a specific file and redirect it into the hash-identifier tool. 
      This approach is useful when you have extracted a hash into a temporary file and want to avoid shell history logging for sensitive data. 
      Ensure the file contains the raw hash string to get an accurate identification of the potential cryptographic signatures.
    command: "hash-identifier < {{file_path}}"

  # === CRACKING PREPARATION ===

  - title: hash-identifier - credential analysis for cracking
    desc: |
      Use the tool to determine which format to use for password recovery tools like Hashcat or John the Ripper. 
      Correctly identifying the hash type (e.g., MD5 vs. NTLM vs. SHA-1) is critical because using the wrong mode in cracking tools will result in zero matches. 
      This tool provides a "Possible Hashs" list and a "Least Possible Hashs" list to help you prioritize your cracking strategy.
