  # === BASIC USAGE ===
  - title: gaia - quick crawl with defaults
    desc: |
      Run Gaia against a single target URL using all default collectors (gau, arjun, linkfinder, uro, and AI reasoning).
      This is a fast way to enumerate endpoints, parameters, and interesting assets for a new target.
    command: "gaia --url {{url}}"

  - title: gaia - process urls from stdin
    desc: |
      Feed Gaia with multiple URLs from a file or pipeline.
      Useful when chaining recon tools or reprocessing historical URL lists.
    command: "cat {{urls_file}} | gaia --stdin"

  # === FOCUS & SPEED ===
  - title: gaia - parameters only without heavy collectors
    desc: |
      Focus on parameterized endpoints and skip historical URL gathering and JS discovery to reduce noise and runtime.
      Disables gau, arjun, and linkfinder while keeping normalization enabled.
    command: "gaia --url {{url}} --only-params --no-gau --no-arjun --no-linkfinder"

  - title: gaia - show static assets and normalize urls
    desc: |
      Include static assets like JS, CSS, and images in the results while keeping normalized URL output.
      Handy for mapping external dependencies or spotting exposed asset paths.
    command: "gaia --url {{url}} --show-assets"

  # === OUTPUT CONTROL ===
  - title: gaia - limit results and auto-install deps
    desc: |
      Cap the number of collected URLs and let Gaia install any missing helper tools automatically.
      Helps prevent runaway output while keeping the toolchain ready.
    command: "gaia --url {{url}} --max-urls {{max_urls|500}} --auto-install"

  - title: gaia - structured report to file
    desc: |
      Export findings to a chosen format (console, md, or json) and save them to disk for later review.
      Combine with other filters to build reproducible recon reports.
    command: "gaia --url {{url}} --format {{format|json}} --output {{output|gaia-report.json}}"

  - title: gaia - disable ai reasoning for strict results
    desc: |
      Turn off Gaia's AI reasoning layer when you need deterministic, tool-only output.
      Keeps historical URL collection, parameter discovery, and JS parsing enabled.
    command: "gaia --url {{url}} --no-ai"
