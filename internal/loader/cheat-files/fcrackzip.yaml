# === PASSWORD RECOVERY ACTIONS ===

actions:
 - title: fcrackzip - dictionary attack
   desc: |
     Performs a password recovery attempt using a specified wordlist. This is generally the most efficient method if the password is a common word or part of a known leak. 
     The -u flag is highly recommended as it uses unzip to weed out false positives, ensuring the found password actually decrypts the file.
     This method is significantly faster than brute-force for complex but common passwords.
   command: "fcrackzip -D -p {{wordlist|/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt}} -u {{zip_file}}"

 - title: fcrackzip - brute force lowercase alphabetic
   desc: |
     Attempts to crack the zip file using a brute-force approach with lowercase characters (a-z). 
     Use this when dictionary attacks fail and you suspect a simple alphabetic password. 
     The -l flag defines the length range (min-max) to search; keeping this range narrow significantly reduces completion time.
     The -b flag explicitly enables the brute-force algorithm.
   command: "fcrackzip -b -c a -l {{min_length|1}}-{{max_length|6}} -u {{zip_file}}"

 - title: fcrackzip - brute force numeric (PIN)
   desc: |
     Specifically targets numeric passwords by using only the digit charset (0-9). 
     This is much faster than a full alphanumeric search and is ideal for recovering PINs or date-based passwords. 
     If you know the exact length of the PIN, set the min and max length to the same value to optimize performance.
     This is often the first brute-force attempt performed after dictionary attacks.
   command: "fcrackzip -b -c 1 -l {{min_length|4}}-{{max_length|6}} -u {{zip_file}}"

 - title: fcrackzip - brute force alphanumeric
   desc: |
     Searches for passwords containing both lowercase letters and numbers. 
     This increases complexity and search time significantly compared to single-charset attacks. 
     The -v (verbose) flag is added here to monitor the progress and see the current passwords being tested.
     Note that as the length increases, the time required grows exponentially.
   command: "fcrackzip -b -c a1 -l {{min_length|1}}-{{max_length|6}} -u -v {{zip_file}}"

 - title: fcrackzip - custom charset brute force
   desc: |
     Allows the user to specify a custom set of characters for the brute-force attack. 
     This is useful if you have partial knowledge of the password composition, such as the inclusion of specific symbols or uppercase letters. 
     Use the -c flag followed by the literal characters you want to include in the search space.
     Be careful with shell-special characters in the charset; you may need to escape them or wrap the charset in quotes.
   command: "fcrackzip -b -c {{charset|aA1!}} -l {{length|5}} -u {{zip_file}}"

 - title: fcrackzip - resume or start from specific string
   desc: |
     Starts the brute-force sequence from a specific initial string. 
     This can be used to manually resume a session that was interrupted or to skip ahead in a predictable sequence. 
     It is particularly useful for distributed cracking where you want different machines to start at different points in the keyspace.
     The length parameter (-l) must be compatible with the initial password provided.
   command: "fcrackzip -b -p {{start_string|aaaa}} -l {{length|4}} -u {{zip_file}}"

# === UTILITY AND PERFORMANCE ===

 - title: fcrackzip - perform benchmark
   desc: |
     Executes a small internal benchmark to test the cracking speed on your current hardware. 
     This helps in estimating how long a large-scale brute-force attack might take given the current CPU constraints. 
     It does not attempt to crack a specific file but rather tests the raw performance of the internal algorithms.
     Use this to compare performance across different systems or virtual machine configurations.
   command: "fcrackzip -B"

 - title: fcrackzip - validation check
   desc: |
     Performs a sanity-check on the cracking algorithm to ensure it is functioning correctly on the current architecture. 
     This is a diagnostic tool used to verify that the software was compiled correctly and yields expected results.
     It is rarely used in daily operations but is vital for troubleshooting unexpected behavior or false negatives.
   command: "fcrackzip -V"

 - title: fcrackzip - specific method selection
   desc: |
     Forces the use of a specific cracking method (e.g., zip2). 
     Different ZIP compression tools use different encryption standards; while fcrackzip defaults to method 2 (zip2), some older or specific files might require method 0 or 1.
     Using the wrong method will result in failed recovery even if the password is correct.
     Check the help output to see which methods are compiled into your specific version of the tool.
   command: "fcrackzip -m {{method_number|2}} -b -l {{length|4}} {{zip_file}}"
