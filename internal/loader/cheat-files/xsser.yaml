actions:
  # === BASIC AUDIT & RECONNAISSANCE ===
  - title: xsser - basic url scan
    desc: |
      Performs a simple audit on a specific target URL. 
      This command is the standard starting point to check if a single page is vulnerable to common XSS vectors. 
      It uses default settings to probe the target without complex configurations.
    command: "xsser -u \"{{url}}\""

  - title: xsser - scan with crawling
    desc: |
      Crawls the target website to discover and audit multiple links. 
      The depth of the crawl can be controlled to limit the scope of the security test. 
      This is highly effective for mapping the attack surface of an entire web application automatically.
    command: "xsser -u \"{{url}}\" -c {{depth|5}}"

  - title: xsser - dorking for targets
    desc: |
      Uses search engine dorks to find potential targets based on a specific query. 
      By default, it uses DuckDuckGo but can be configured to use others. 
      This is often used by researchers to find vulnerable instances of specific software across the internet.
    command: "xsser -d \"{{dork|index.php?id=}}\" --De {{engine|google}}"

  # === INJECTION METHODS ===
  - title: xsser - GET parameter injection
    desc: |
      Targets a specific GET parameter for XSS injection using the 'XSS' keyword as a placeholder. 
      The tool replaces 'XSS' with its internal payloads to test for reflections. 
      Use this when you have identified a specific input field in a URL query string.
    command: "xsser -u \"{{url}}\" -g \"{{path}}?{{param}}=XSS\""

  - title: xsser - POST data injection
    desc: |
      Sends XSS payloads through POST data instead of the URL. 
      This is necessary for testing forms, login fields, and other data submission points that do not use GET. 
      Ensure the data string matches the expected application/x-www-form-urlencoded format.
    command: "xsser -u \"{{url}}\" -p \"{{param1}}=value&{{param2}}=XSS\""

  # === ADVANCED TECHNIQUES ===
  - title: xsser - cookie and header injection
    desc: |
      Tests for XSS vulnerabilities within HTTP headers such as Cookies, User-Agent, and Referer. 
      These are often overlooked injection points that can lead to stored or reflected XSS in administrative dashboards. 
      The command enables multiple special techniques simultaneously for a broad header audit.
    command: "xsser -u \"{{url}}\" --Coo --Xsa --Xsr"

  - title: xsser - DOM based XSS testing
    desc: |
      Focuses on discovering Document Object Model (DOM) based XSS vulnerabilities. 
      It analyzes how the client-side scripts handle input from the URL fragment or other sources. 
      DOM XSS is critical because the payload never reaches the server-side logs in many cases.
    command: "xsser -u \"{{url}}\" --Dom"

  # === EVASION & BYPASSING ===
  - title: xsser - bypass WAF with specific rules
    desc: |
      Attempts to bypass specific Web Application Firewalls (WAF) using pre-defined rulesets. 
      Available options include Modsec, Imperva, Barracuda, and more. 
      Use this when a target is protected by a known security solution that blocks standard XSS payloads.
    command: "xsser -u \"{{url}}\" --auto --{{waf_type|Modsec}}"

  - title: xsser - encoding and obfuscation bypass
    desc: |
      Applies various encoding techniques like Hexadecimal, Decimal, or String.FromCharCode() to the payloads. 
      Obfuscation helps in evading simple signature-based detection systems and input filters. 
      Combining multiple encodings can increase the success rate against complex filters.
    command: "xsser -u \"{{url}}\" --auto --Str --Hex --Une"

  # === SPECIAL FEATURES ===
  - title: xsser - generate malicious image (IMX)
    desc: |
      Creates an image file embedded with XSS code to test for vulnerabilities in image processing libraries. 
      This technique is used to exploit "Image XSS" where a site renders metadata or malicious byte sequences as code. 
      The resulting file should be uploaded to the target for testing.
    command: "xsser --imx {{output_file|path/to/image.png}}"

  - title: xsser - Denial of Service (DoS) attack
    desc: |
      Attempts to perform a client-side or server-side Denial of Service via XSS. 
      This typically involves injecting scripts that consume excessive resources on the victim's browser or the server. 
      Use with extreme caution as it can impact the availability of the target service.
    command: "xsser -u \"{{url}}\" --Dos"

  # === REPORTING & OUTPUT ===
  - title: xsser - export results to XML
    desc: |
      Saves the findings of the audit into a structured XML file for further analysis or integration. 
      This is useful for professional reporting or for feeding data into other security tools. 
      The report includes details about the injected payloads and the vulnerable parameters.
    command: "xsser -u \"{{url}}\" --auto --xml {{filename|report.xml}}"

  - title: xsser - launch GUI mode
    desc: |
      Launches the graphical user interface for XSSer. 
      This is helpful for users who prefer a visual representation of the attack configuration and results. 
      It requires a desktop environment and the necessary GTK libraries installed.
    command: "xsser --gtk"
