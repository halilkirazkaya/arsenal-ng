# === ENUMERATION ACTIONS ===

actions:
 - title: snmp-check - basic enumeration
   desc: |
     Performs a standard SNMP enumeration against a target using default settings. 
     This command attempts to retrieve system information, network interfaces, and running processes using the 'public' community string and SNMPv1.
     It is the most common starting point for gathering intelligence from a networked device like a router, switch, or server.
     Note that many modern systems might have the default 'public' community string disabled for security reasons.
   command: "snmp-check {{target}}"

 - title: snmp-check - custom community string
   desc: |
     Connects to the target using a specific SNMP community string. 
     Community strings act as a clear-text password in SNMP versions 1 and 2c to authorize access to the Management Information Base (MIB). 
     If the default 'public' string is not accepted, you must provide a valid string discovered via brute-force or documentation.
     Successful authentication can reveal sensitive data such as routing tables, software versions, and user accounts.
   command: "snmp-check -c {{community|public}} {{target}}"

 - title: snmp-check - version 2c enumeration
   desc: |
     Forces the tool to use SNMP version 2c for communication with the target. 
     SNMPv2c is more prevalent in modern environments as it supports 64-bit counters and provides better error handling than version 1. 
     Using this version is often necessary when scanning high-performance networking equipment or newer operating systems.
     If the target does not respond to version 1 requests, switching to 2c is the logical next step.
   command: "snmp-check -v 2c -c {{community|public}} {{target}}"

 - title: snmp-check - custom port scan
   desc: |
     Directs the tool to a specific UDP port instead of the default SNMP port 161. 
     Administrators sometimes move the SNMP service to a non-standard port to hide it from automated scanners or to avoid conflicts. 
     You should use this option if your initial port scan (e.g., via Nmap) identified an SNMP service running elsewhere.
     Always ensure that the target port is reachable and not blocked by intermediate firewalls.
   command: "snmp-check -p {{port|161}} {{target}}"

# === SPECIALIZED CHECKS ===

 - title: snmp-check - write access detection
   desc: |
     Specifically tests whether the provided community string grants write permissions on the target. 
     Finding an SNMP community string with write access is a critical security vulnerability, as it may allow an attacker to modify device configurations. 
     This action is performed as a separate check from the standard enumeration to highlight potential exploitation paths.
     Be cautious when testing write access on production systems, as unauthorized changes can lead to service disruptions.
   command: "snmp-check -c {{community|private}} -w {{target}}"

 - title: snmp-check - disable tcp enumeration
   desc: |
     Instructs the tool to skip the enumeration of TCP connections and listening ports. 
     This is useful for speeding up the scanning process when you only care about hardware details or network interface statistics. 
     It also reduces the amount of SNMP traffic sent, making the scan slightly less noisy on the network.
     Use this flag if the target has a massive number of active connections that cause the tool to hang or produce excessive output.
   command: "snmp-check -d {{target}}"

# === PERFORMANCE & TIMING ===

 - title: snmp-check - timing and retries tuning
   desc: |
     Adjusts the timeout duration and the number of retries for SNMP requests. 
     These parameters are vital when scanning targets over high-latency links, satellite connections, or unstable networks. 
     Increasing the timeout ensures the tool waits longer for a response, while increasing retries helps overcome packet loss.
     The default timeout is 5 seconds, and the default retry count is 1.
   command: "snmp-check -t {{timeout|5}} -r {{retries|1}} {{target}}"
