  # === BASIC ENUMERATION ===
  - title: httpx - basic target probing
    desc: |
      Performs a basic HTTP probe on a single target to check for live web services. 
      This is the simplest way to verify if a host is running a web server on default ports. 
      It returns the URL of the active service if a successful connection is established.
    command: "httpx -u {{target}}"

  - title: httpx - bulk enumeration with status and title
    desc: |
      Probes a list of hosts and displays the HTTP status code, page title, and web server information. 
      This is highly effective for large-scale reconnaissance to quickly identify interesting targets. 
      The status codes help distinguish between accessible pages, redirects, and unauthorized areas.
    command: "httpx -l {{list_file|subdomains.txt}} -sc -title -server"

  - title: httpx - technology and content analysis
    desc: |
      Probes targets to detect the underlying technology stack, content length, and response time. 
      The technology detection (Wappalyzer-based) is crucial for identifying CMS, frameworks, or specific libraries. 
      Content length help in identifying outliers or unique pages across many subdomains.
    command: "httpx -l {{list_file|subdomains.txt}} -td -cl -rt"

  # === FILTERING AND MATCHING ===
  - title: httpx - match specific status codes
    desc: |
      Filters the output to only show results that match the specified HTTP status codes. 
      This is useful when looking specifically for successful logins (200), redirects (302), or forbidden areas (403). 
      Multiple codes can be provided as a comma-separated list.
    command: "httpx -l {{list_file}} -mc {{status_codes|200,301,302}}"

  - title: httpx - filter out common error pages
    desc: |
      Excludes specific status codes from the results to reduce noise during large scans. 
      Commonly used to hide 404 Not Found or 403 Forbidden pages when they are not relevant to the current task. 
      This keeps the terminal output clean and focused on valid web assets.
    command: "httpx -l {{list_file}} -fc {{filter_codes|404,400}}"

  - title: httpx - search for specific strings in body
    desc: |
      Matches responses that contain a specific string or keyword in the body of the page. 
      This is extremely powerful for finding sensitive keywords like "admin", "dashboard", or "internal". 
      Be aware that this increases processing time as the full body must be inspected.
    command: "httpx -l {{list_file}} -ms {{search_string|admin}}"

  # === ADVANCED PROBING ===
  - title: httpx - custom port and path probing
    desc: |
      Probes specific ports and paths for a given list of targets using Nmap-style syntax. 
      This allows for the discovery of administrative panels or hidden APIs located on non-standard ports. 
      Ensure you use the correct protocol prefix if you are targeting specific port ranges.
    command: "httpx -l {{list_file}} -p {{ports|80,443,8080,8443}} -path {{paths|/admin,/api/v1}}"

  - title: httpx - headless screenshots
    desc: |
      Captures visual screenshots of the targeted web pages using a headless browser. 
      This provides a visual confirmation of the content, making it easier to identify login forms or parking pages. 
      Note that this requires more system resources and may require a local Chrome installation with the -system-chrome flag.
    command: "httpx -l {{list_file}} -ss -system-chrome -srd {{output_dir|screenshots}}"

  - title: httpx - CDN and WAF detection
    desc: |
      Identifies if a target is behind a Content Delivery Network (CDN) or a Web Application Firewall (WAF). 
      This information is vital for determining the feasibility of certain attacks or bypasses. 
      The results help in mapping the infrastructure and understanding the security perimeter of the target.
    command: "httpx -l {{list_file}} -cdn -ip -asn"

  # === FILE OPERATIONS & OUTPUT ===
  - title: httpx - comprehensive JSON output
    desc: |
      Exports all probe results including full request and response headers into a JSON Lines format. 
      This format is ideal for further automated processing or for importing into databases. 
      Including the full response data allows for offline analysis without re-sending packets to the target.
    command: "httpx -l {{list_file}} -json -o {{output_file|results.json}} -irr"

  - title: httpx - store raw responses
    desc: |
      Saves the actual HTTP response bodies into a specified directory for manual inspection. 
      This is particularly useful when you need to grep through local files for sensitive data later. 
      Be cautious about disk space when running this against thousands of large targets.
    command: "httpx -l {{list_file}} -sr -srd {{response_dir|saved_responses}}"

  # === NETWORK & INFRASTRUCTURE ===
  - title: httpx - Favicon hash extraction
    desc: |
      Calculates the MurmurHash3 (mmh3) of the target's favicon.ico file. 
      Favicon hashes are used by security researchers to identify related assets across different IP ranges via Shodan or Censys. 
      This is a key technique in infrastructure mapping and tracking organizational footprints.
    command: "httpx -l {{list_file}} -favicon"

  - title: httpx - TLS/SSL data grabbing
    desc: |
      Extracts detailed information from the TLS/SSL certificates of the targets. 
      It can reveal Subject Alternative Names (SANs), which often contain previously undiscovered subdomains. 
      This probe is essential for understanding the certificate authority and expiration dates of web assets.
    command: "httpx -l {{list_file}} -tls-grab -jarm"

  - title: httpx - follow redirects
    desc: |
      Instructs the tool to follow HTTP redirects and report the final destination URL. 
      By default, httpx may only report the initial 301/302 response; this flag shows where the user actually ends up. 
      You can limit the number of redirects to prevent infinite loops using the -maxr flag.
    command: "httpx -l {{list_file}} -fr -maxr {{max_redirects|5}}"

  # === OPTIMIZATIONS ===
  - title: httpx - rate limited stealth scan
    desc: |
      Controls the speed of the scan by limiting the number of requests per second. 
      This is useful for avoiding rate limits, WAF blocks, or overwhelming small servers. 
      Adjusting threads and rate-limit ensures a balance between speed and reliability.
    command: "httpx -l {{list_file}} -t {{threads|20}} -rl {{rate_limit|50}}"
