  # === SEARCHING OPERATIONS ===
  - title: searchsploit - basic exploit search
    desc: |
      Search for exploits and shellcodes in the local Exploit-DB database using one or more keywords. 
      This is the most common starting point for finding public proof-of-concept code for a target service. 
      By default, the tool performs a case-insensitive search across both titles and file paths.
    command: "searchsploit {{search_terms}}"

  - title: searchsploit - search by exploit title only
    desc: |
      Perform a search restricted solely to the exploit titles, ignoring the file path. 
      This is extremely useful for reducing false positives when searching for version numbers like "2.0". 
      Folder names often contain numbers that can clutter results if path searching is enabled.
    command: "searchsploit -t {{search_term}}"

  - title: searchsploit - exact title match
    desc: |
      Perform an exact and order-sensitive match on the exploit title. 
      Use this when you know the specific name of a vulnerability or software and want to avoid similar but irrelevant results. 
      For example, searching for "WordPress 4.1" with this flag will not return "WordPress Core 4.1".
    command: "searchsploit -e {{exact_title}}"

  - title: searchsploit - search using cve identifier
    desc: |
      Search the database for exploits associated with a specific Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID. 
      This is highly effective after running vulnerability scanners like Nessus or OpenVAS that provide CVE numbers. 
      It directly links identified vulnerabilities to available exploitation scripts in the repository.
    command: "searchsploit --cve {{cve_id|2021-44228}}"

  - title: searchsploit - case sensitive search
    desc: |
      Execute a search where the case of the letters in the search term matters. 
      Standard searches are case-insensitive, but specific software names might require case sensitivity to filter results. 
      This helps narrow down results when a common word is part of a specific product name.
    command: "searchsploit -c {{search_term}}"

  - title: searchsploit - exclude specific terms
    desc: |
      Filter out unwanted results from the search output by defining terms to exclude. 
      You can chain multiple exclusion terms using the pipe symbol within the quotes. 
      This is useful for removing "Denial of Service" (DoS) exploits or "PoC" files when looking for functional remote exploits.
    command: "searchsploit {{search_term}} --exclude={{exclude_pattern|'(PoC)|/dos/'}}"

  # === FILE & CONTENT OPERATIONS ===
  - title: searchsploit - mirror exploit to current directory
    desc: |
      Copy a specific exploit file from the local repository directly to your current working directory. 
      This eliminates the need to manually navigate the file system to find the script location. 
      Once mirrored, you can easily modify, compile, or execute the exploit for your engagement.
    command: "searchsploit -m {{edb_id}}"

  - title: searchsploit - examine exploit content
    desc: |
      Open the source code of an exploit using the system's default pager (usually 'less'). 
      This allows you to quickly inspect the exploit's requirements, usage instructions, and potential risks. 
      Always examine exploit code before execution to ensure it does not contain malicious payloads or destructive behavior.
    command: "searchsploit -x {{edb_id}}"

  - title: searchsploit - show exploit path and copy to clipboard
    desc: |
      Display the full absolute path of an exploit file on the local system. 
      On supported systems, this command also attempts to copy the file path to the clipboard for easy pasting. 
      It is useful when you need to provide the path to another tool or manual compiler.
    command: "searchsploit -p {{edb_id}}"

  # === OUTPUT FORMATTING ===
  - title: searchsploit - display results as json
    desc: |
      Generate search results in JSON format instead of the standard tabular view. 
      This is essential for automation scripts or when you need to pipe data into other tools like 'jq'. 
      JSON output provides detailed metadata about each exploit entry including ID, title, and platform.
    command: "searchsploit -j {{search_term}}"

  - title: searchsploit - show exploit-db urls
    desc: |
      Display the full web URLs to the Exploit-DB website for each search result instead of local file paths. 
      This is helpful if you are working on a machine without the full database or need to share a link with a colleague. 
      It allows for quick access to the online documentation and comments section for each exploit.
    command: "searchsploit -w {{search_term}}"

  # === AUTOMATION & MAINTENANCE ===
  - title: searchsploit - analyze nmap xml output
    desc: |
      Read an Nmap XML scan file and automatically search for exploits for all detected service versions. 
      This significantly speeds up the transition from scanning to the exploitation phase of a pentest. 
      It checks the version strings identified by Nmap's service detection against the local exploit database.
    command: "searchsploit --nmap {{nmap_xml_file}}"

  - title: searchsploit - update exploit database
    desc: |
      Update the local exploit-database repository to the latest available version. 
      This command fetches new exploits and shellcodes from the central Git repository or package manager. 
      Regular updates are critical to ensure you have access to the most recent public exploits for newly discovered vulnerabilities.
    command: "searchsploit -u"
