  # === RECONNAISSANCE & IDENTIFICATION ===
  - title: wafw00f - basic WAF detection
    desc: |
      Identify the Web Application Firewall (WAF) protecting a specific URL. 
      This command sends a series of probes to analyze HTTP responses and header fingerprints. 
      It is the most common starting point during the reconnaissance phase of a web assessment.
    command: "wafw00f {{url}}"

  - title: wafw00f - list supported WAFs
    desc: |
      Display all WAF products that the tool is currently capable of detecting. 
      This is useful for verifying if a specific vendor's signature is included in the tool's database. 
      Run this command before performing targeted tests to ensure the desired WAF is supported.
    command: "wafw00f -l"

  - title: wafw00f - verbose detection
    desc: |
      Increase the verbosity of the output to see technical details about the detection process. 
      This helps in understanding which specific response characteristics triggered a WAF identification. 
      You can use multiple 'v' flags (e.g., -vv or -vvv) for even more granular logging of requests and responses.
    command: "wafw00f {{url}} -v"

  - title: wafw00f - exhaustive search
    desc: |
      Continue testing even after a WAF is identified to see if multiple layers of protection exist. 
      By default, wafw00f stops after the first successful match to save time. 
      This is particularly useful for complex enterprise environments where a CDN-based WAF might sit in front of an on-premise appliance.
    command: "wafw00f {{url}} -a"

  - title: wafw00f - test for specific WAF
    desc: |
      Target a specific WAF product signature directly to see if it is present on the destination server. 
      This is efficient when you have prior knowledge of the target's infrastructure or suspect a specific technology. 
      It skips the general automated discovery sequence and focuses only on the specified signature.
    command: "wafw00f {{url}} -t {{waf_name|Cloudflare}}"

  # === BATCH OPERATIONS & OUTPUT ===
  - title: wafw00f - batch scan from file
    desc: |
      Read multiple target URLs from a local file for automated batch processing. 
      The input file can be in text, CSV, or JSON format, allowing for easy integration with other tool outputs. 
      This is the preferred method for scanning large IP ranges or extensive lists of subdomains.
    command: "wafw00f -i {{input_file|targets.txt}}"

  - title: wafw00f - save results to file
    desc: |
      Write the detection results to a structured file for later analysis or reporting. 
      The tool determines the output format (CSV, JSON, or Text) based on the file extension provided. 
      This is essential for maintaining an audit trail and sharing findings with a security team.
    command: "wafw00f {{url}} -o {{output_file|results.json}}"

  # === ADVANCED CONFIGURATION ===
  - title: wafw00f - scan via proxy
    desc: |
      Route all detection requests through an HTTP or SOCKS proxy server. 
      This can be used to bypass IP-based rate limiting or to mask the source of the scanning activity. 
      The tool supports various proxy strings including socks5:// and authenticated http:// proxies.
    command: "wafw00f {{url}} -p {{proxy_url|http://127.0.0.1:8080}}"

  - title: wafw00f - use custom headers
    desc: |
      Pass a text file containing custom HTTP headers to be sent with every request probe. 
      This is useful when the target application requires specific User-Agents, Cookies, or Authorization headers to respond normally. 
      Using custom headers can help bypass simple access controls that might otherwise block the tool's traffic.
    command: "wafw00f {{url}} -H {{headers_file|headers.txt}}"

  - title: wafw00f - disable redirects and set timeout
    desc: |
      Prevent the tool from following HTTP 3xx redirects and define a custom network timeout. 
      Disabling redirects is important when you want to analyze the security of the entry point specifically without being sent to an external domain. 
      Adjusting the timeout is helpful when scanning high-latency targets or unstable network environments.
    command: "wafw00f {{url}} -r -T {{seconds|15}}"
