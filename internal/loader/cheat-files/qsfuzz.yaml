  # === BASIC USAGE ===
  - title: qsfuzz - basic query string fuzzing
    desc: |
      Performs basic fuzzing on a list of URLs provided via standard input. 
      This is the primary way to use the tool, typically by piping output from discovery tools like gau or waybackurls. 
      It checks the parameters against built-in or default rules to find potential vulnerabilities.
    command: "cat {{url_list}} | qsfuzz"

  - title: qsfuzz - fuzzing with custom configuration
    desc: |
      Executes the fuzzer using a specific configuration file containing custom rules. 
      The config file allows you to define specific payloads and matching patterns for vulnerabilities like XSS, SQLi, or SSRF. 
      This is essential for targeted testing where default rules might not be sufficient for the specific technology stack.
    command: "cat {{url_list}} | qsfuzz -c {{config_path|~/.config/qsfuzz/config.yaml}}"

  # === AUTHENTICATION & HEADERS ===
  - title: qsfuzz - authenticated fuzzing with headers
    desc: |
      Adds custom HTTP headers to all fuzzing requests sent by the tool. 
      This is crucial for testing endpoints that require authorization tokens or custom headers for identification. 
      Multiple headers can be included by separating them with a semi-colon within the string.
    command: "cat {{url_list}} | qsfuzz -H \"{{headers|Authorization: Bearer token; X-Custom-Header: value}}\""

  - title: qsfuzz - authenticated fuzzing with cookies
    desc: |
      Includes session cookies in every request to fuzz protected or authenticated areas of a web application. 
      This allows the fuzzer to reach internal logic and parameters that are not accessible to unauthenticated users. 
      Ensure the cookies are valid and the session is active before starting the long-running scan.
    command: "cat {{url_list}} | qsfuzz -cookies \"{{cookies|session=abc123xyz}}\""

  # === PERFORMANCE & OPTIMIZATION ===
  - title: qsfuzz - high-concurrency fuzzing
    desc: |
      Sets the number of concurrent workers and adjusts the request timeout for faster processing. 
      Increasing the worker count can significantly speed up the scanning of large URL lists but may lead to rate limiting. 
      Setting a lower timeout helps the tool skip unresponsive servers quickly to maintain overall scanning momentum.
    command: "cat {{url_list}} | qsfuzz -w {{workers|50}} -t {{timeout|10}}"

  - title: qsfuzz - silent mode for automation
    desc: |
      Mutes all status updates and only prints successful evaluations or positive matches to the terminal. 
      This mode is specifically designed for use in automation pipelines and shell scripts where only the findings are relevant. 
      It prevents the terminal or log files from being cluttered with progress indicators and non-critical information.
    command: "cat {{url_list}} | qsfuzz -s"

  # === ADVANCED BEHAVIOR ===
  - title: qsfuzz - fuzzing with decoded parameters
    desc: |
      Sends fuzzing requests with decoded query strings and parameters instead of URL-encoded ones. 
      This technique can sometimes bypass security filters or WAFs that only inspect encoded inputs. 
      Be cautious as this might cause some web servers to return 400 Bad Request errors if they expect standard encoding.
    command: "cat {{url_list}} | qsfuzz -d"

  - title: qsfuzz - disable redirect following
    desc: |
      Prevents the tool from following HTTP redirects (3xx status codes) during the fuzzing process. 
      By default, qsfuzz follows redirects, but disabling it is useful when you want to analyze the immediate response of the target URL. 
      This can help in identifying Open Redirect vulnerabilities or specific server behaviors on the initial landing page.
    command: "cat {{url_list}} | qsfuzz -nr"

  # === INTEGRATION ===
  - title: qsfuzz - slack notification integration
    desc: |
      Sends all positive matches and discovered vulnerabilities directly to a Slack channel via a webhook. 
      The Slack API key and destination details must be correctly configured in the qsfuzz config file beforehand. 
      This is an excellent feature for continuous monitoring or long-running scans where you want real-time alerts on your mobile or desktop.
    command: "cat {{url_list}} | qsfuzz -ts"

  - title: qsfuzz - debug mode for troubleshooting
    desc: |
      Enables verbose debug mode to provide more detailed information about failed or malformed requests. 
      This is extremely helpful when the tool is not behaving as expected or when you are trying to debug connectivity issues. 
      It will print detailed error messages for every URL that fails to process, helping you refine your input list or configuration.
    command: "cat {{url_list}} | qsfuzz -debug"
