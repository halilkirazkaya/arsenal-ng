  # === BASIC TARGETING ===
  - title: crlfuzz - basic scan of a single URL
    desc: |
      Performs a targeted scan for CRLF injection vulnerabilities on a single specified URL. 
      The tool injects various payloads into the headers to detect if the server is susceptible to HTTP Response Splitting. 
      This is the most common starting point when you have identified a specific suspicious endpoint.
    command: "crlfuzz -u {{url}}"

  - title: crlfuzz - scan URLs from a list
    desc: |
      Reads multiple target URLs from a text file and performs automated fuzzing on each entry. 
      This is highly efficient for large-scale reconnaissance and bug bounty hunting when you have a list of subdomains. 
      Ensure the file contains one URL per line for the tool to process them correctly.
    command: "crlfuzz -l {{file_path}}"

  - title: crlfuzz - scan from standard input (stdin)
    desc: |
      Enables the tool to receive URLs directly from the output of other tools in a pipeline. 
      When no input flag is provided, crlfuzz waits for data from stdin, making it perfect for chaining with tools like subfinder or httpx. 
      This approach is essential for building fully automated vulnerability scanning workflows.
    command: "crlfuzz {{options}}"

  # === REQUEST CONFIGURATION ===
  - title: crlfuzz - specify HTTP request method
    desc: |
      Allows you to define a specific HTTP method such as POST, PUT, or DELETE instead of the default GET method. 
      CRLF vulnerabilities can often be triggered through specific methods that handle headers or data differently. 
      Use this when testing REST APIs or endpoints that require specific interaction types.
    command: "crlfuzz -u {{url}} -X {{method|POST}}"

  - title: crlfuzz - scan with request body data
    desc: |
      Sends custom data within the request body, which is typically required for POST, PATCH, or DELETE methods. 
      This allows for the testing of endpoints that require specific parameters to reach the logic where headers are processed. 
      Be careful with the data format to ensure it matches what the target server expects (e.g., JSON or form-encoded).
    command: "crlfuzz -u {{url}} -X {{method|POST}} -d {{data}}"

  - title: crlfuzz - pass custom headers
    desc: |
      Includes custom HTTP headers in the outgoing request, such as specialized User-Agents or Authorization tokens. 
      This is critical for scanning authenticated areas of an application where a session cookie or bearer token is required. 
      You can also use this to simulate specific client environments or bypass basic header-based filters.
    command: "crlfuzz -u {{url}} -H \"{{header_name}}: {{header_value}}\""

  # === PERFORMANCE & PROXY ===
  - title: crlfuzz - set concurrency level
    desc: |
      Adjusts the number of concurrent fuzzing tasks running at the same time to optimize scanning speed. 
      The default concurrency is 25, but you can increase it for faster results on robust servers or decrease it to avoid overwhelming the target. 
      Setting this too high might lead to rate-limiting or false negatives due to network congestion.
    command: "crlfuzz -l {{file_path}} -c {{concurrency|50}}"

  - title: crlfuzz - route traffic through a proxy
    desc: |
      Directs all fuzzing traffic through a specified proxy server, such as Burp Suite or OWASP ZAP. 
      This allows you to manually inspect the payloads being sent and the responses received from the server. 
      The proxy string must include the protocol, for example, http://127.0.0.1:8080.
    command: "crlfuzz -u {{url}} -x {{proxy_url|http://127.0.0.1:8080}}"

  # === OUTPUT & LOGGING ===
  - title: crlfuzz - silent mode for vulnerable targets
    desc: |
      Activates silent mode, which suppresses all standard output except for the URLs found to be vulnerable. 
      This is extremely useful when piping results into other tools or saving only actionable findings to a log. 
      It reduces terminal noise significantly during large-scale automated scans.
    command: "crlfuzz -l {{file_path}} -s"

  - title: crlfuzz - verbose mode for debugging
    desc: |
      Enables verbose output to display detailed error messages and progress information. 
      Use this when the tool is not behaving as expected or when you need to troubleshoot connection issues. 
      It provides more context on why certain requests might be failing during the fuzzing process.
    command: "crlfuzz -l {{file_path}} -v"

  - title: crlfuzz - save results to a file
    desc: |
      Automatically saves the output of the fuzzing process to a specified text file. 
      This is recommended for long-running scans to ensure that no findings are lost due to terminal buffer limits. 
      The output file will contain the details of the vulnerabilities discovered for later reporting.
    command: "crlfuzz -l {{file_path}} -o {{output_file}}"
