actions:
  # === BASIC SEARCH ===
  - title: sherlock - search for a single username
    desc: |
      Search for a specific username across a massive list of social media platforms and websites. 
      This is the primary function of Sherlock, used to map a target's digital footprint and identify associated accounts. 
      The results are displayed in the terminal and automatically saved to a text file named after the username.
    command: "sherlock {{username}}"

  - title: sherlock - search for multiple usernames
    desc: |
      Search for multiple distinct usernames simultaneously in one execution. 
      This is highly efficient when investigating an individual who might use variations of a handle or when investigating a group. 
      Each username will have its results stored in its own individual text file within the current directory.
    command: "sherlock {{username_1}} {{username_2}} {{username_3}}"

  # === OUTPUT MANAGEMENT ===
  - title: sherlock - export results to CSV
    desc: |
      Generate a Comma-Separated Values (CSV) file containing the search results. 
      This format is ideal for importing the discovered data into spreadsheet software or other automated OSINT tools for further analysis. 
      It provides a structured way to view which platforms the username was found on versus where it was not.
    command: "sherlock {{username}} --csv"

  - title: sherlock - export results to Excel (XLSX)
    desc: |
      Save the search findings into a modern Microsoft Excel (xlsx) format. 
      Use this when you need a formatted report that is easy to share with non-technical stakeholders or for formal documentation. 
      It organizes the discovered URLs and site names into a clean, readable spreadsheet structure.
    command: "sherlock {{username}} --xlsx"

  - title: sherlock - specify output directory
    desc: |
      Redirect all generated output files into a specific folder of your choice. 
      This is particularly useful when performing bulk searches for multiple users to keep the workspace organized. 
      If the specified directory does not exist, Sherlock will attempt to create it before saving the results.
    command: "sherlock {{username_list}} --folderoutput {{directory_path}}"

  # === FILTERING AND OPTIMIZATION ===
  - title: sherlock - limit search to specific sites
    desc: |
      Restrict the username search to one or more specific platforms instead of the entire database. 
      This significantly reduces execution time and avoids noise when you are only interested in certain networks like Twitter or GitHub. 
      Multiple sites can be specified by repeating the flag for each target platform.
    command: "sherlock {{username}} --site {{site_name|twitter}}"

  - title: sherlock - include NSFW sites
    desc: |
      Explicitly include adult/NSFW websites in the search criteria. 
      By default, Sherlock excludes these sites to maintain a "safe for work" output, but they can be crucial for comprehensive investigations. 
      Use this flag when a full digital footprint is required regardless of the content category.
    command: "sherlock {{username}} --nsfw"

  - title: sherlock - set custom request timeout
    desc: |
      Adjust the maximum time in seconds that Sherlock waits for a response from each website. 
      The default is 60 seconds, but increasing it can help on slow networks, while decreasing it can speed up the scan at the risk of false negatives. 
      This is an important parameter to tune when dealing with rate-limiting or unstable connections.
    command: "sherlock {{username}} --timeout {{seconds|20}}"

  # === CONNECTIVITY AND ANONYMITY ===
  - title: sherlock - route traffic through Tor
    desc: |
      Route all web requests through the Tor network to mask your IP address. 
      This provides anonymity during the investigation and helps bypass IP-based rate limits or geo-blocking. 
      Note that Tor must be installed and running on your system for this command to function correctly.
    command: "sherlock {{username}} --tor"

  - title: sherlock - use unique Tor circuit for each request
    desc: |
      Force Sherlock to request a new Tor circuit (new IP address) for every single site check. 
      This is the highest level of anonymity and is extremely effective against platforms that implement strict anti-scraping measures. 
      Expect significantly slower performance due to the overhead of establishing new circuits repeatedly.
    command: "sherlock {{username}} --unique-tor"

  - title: sherlock - route through a specific proxy
    desc: |
      Perform the search using a specific proxy server instead of your direct connection. 
      Supported protocols usually include HTTP, HTTPS, and SOCKS; this is useful for routing traffic through a specific geographic region or corporate gateway. 
      Ensure the proxy URL is formatted correctly (e.g., socks5://127.0.0.1:1080).
    command: "sherlock {{username}} --proxy {{proxy_url}}"

  # === ADVANCED WORKFLOW ===
  - title: sherlock - open results in browser automatically
    desc: |
      Automatically open every discovered profile URL in your default web browser once the scan completes. 
      This allows for immediate manual verification of the accounts found by the tool. 
      Be cautious when using this with usernames that appear on many sites, as it may open dozens of browser tabs simultaneously.
    command: "sherlock {{username}} --browse"

  - title: sherlock - verbose debugging output
    desc: |
      Enable detailed logging to see the internal status of each request and metric. 
      This is highly useful for troubleshooting why a specific site might be failing or to confirm that the proxy settings are working as intended. 
      It provides extra context on response codes and connection attempts during the enumeration process.
    command: "sherlock {{username}} --verbose"
