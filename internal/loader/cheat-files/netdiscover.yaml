  # === RECONNAISSANCE & SCANNING ===

  - title: netdiscover - basic auto scan
    desc: |
      Performs an automatic scan of common private network ranges (192.168.0.0/16, 172.16.0.0/12, 10.0.0.0/8).
      This is highly effective when you are connected to a network but do not know the local IP addressing scheme.
      Note that this tool requires root or sudo privileges because it utilizes raw sockets to craft and send ARP packets.
      It will continue to run and update the list as new devices are discovered until manually stopped.
    command: "netdiscover"

  - title: netdiscover - scan specific IP range
    desc: |
      Scans a specific CIDR range provided by the user to identify active hosts.
      This is the most common way to perform targeted discovery within a known subnet like 192.168.1.0/24.
      Using a specific range is much faster than the default auto-scan mode and generates less noise on the network.
      The results will display the IP address, MAC address, MAC vendor, and the number of packets received.
    command: "netdiscover -r {{range}}"

  - title: netdiscover - passive listening mode
    desc: |
      Enables passive mode where the tool does not send any ARP requests to the network.
      It acts as a silent sniffer, identifying hosts solely by monitoring the ARP traffic generated by other devices.
      This is the most stealthy method of reconnaissance as it leaves no footprint and cannot be detected by basic IDS.
      It is particularly useful in red teaming scenarios where active scanning might trigger security alerts.
    command: "netdiscover -p"

  - title: netdiscover - specify network interface
    desc: |
      Forces netdiscover to use a specific network interface for its operations.
      This is necessary when your machine has multiple network cards, such as a wired ethernet connection and a wireless adapter.
      Specifying the interface ensures that ARP requests are sent out through the correct physical or virtual gateway.
      Common interface names include eth0, wlan0, or tap0 depending on your environment.
    command: "netdiscover -i {{interface|eth0}}"

  # === PERFORMANCE & OPTIMIZATION ===

  - title: netdiscover - enable fast mode
    desc: |
      Runs the ARP sweep in fast mode which significantly reduces the total scanning time.
      It is recommended for initial reconnaissance where speed is prioritized over thoroughness.
      Fast mode works by optimizing the internal timing of packet transmissions during the discovery process.
      Be aware that in very large or congested networks, high speed might lead to missing some hosts that respond slowly.
    command: "netdiscover -r {{range}} -f"

  - title: netdiscover - custom timing and retries
    desc: |
      Allows fine-tuning of the scan speed and reliability by setting custom sleep times and retry counts.
      The -s flag sets the delay in milliseconds between each ARP request, while -c sets how many times each request is repeated.
      Increasing the count (default is 1) helps in discovering hosts on unreliable networks with high packet loss.
      Decreasing the sleep time makes the scan faster but may overwhelm small network devices or trigger flood protections.
    command: "netdiscover -r {{range}} -s {{sleep_ms|100}} -c {{count|3}}"

  - title: netdiscover - hardcore sleep suppression
    desc: |
      Enables "hardcore mode" by suppressing the sleep time between each ARP request.
      This will send packets as fast as the system and network interface can handle them.
      Use this with caution as it is extremely noisy and might be interpreted as a Denial of Service (DoS) attempt by some network monitors.
      It is primarily used for stress testing or very rapid discovery in controlled environments.
    command: "netdiscover -r {{range}} -S"

  # === INPUT & OUTPUT MANAGEMENT ===

  - title: netdiscover - scan ranges from file
    desc: |
      Reads a list of target IP ranges from a text file and scans them one by one.
      The file should contain one range per line in standard CIDR notation or range format.
      This is ideal for large-scale assessments where you need to scan multiple non-contiguous subnets automatically.
      It helps in maintaining a structured workflow by keeping target lists organized in external files.
    command: "netdiscover -l {{file_path}}"

  - title: netdiscover - parsable output for scripting
    desc: |
      Formats the scan results into a simplified, machine-readable output that is easy to parse with other tools like grep, awk, or custom scripts.
      The -P flag ensures the tool prints the results and exits immediately after the active scan is completed.
      This is essential for automation and integrating netdiscover into a larger reconnaissance pipeline.
      Adding the -N flag can further simplify output by removing the header information.
    command: "netdiscover -r {{range}} -P"

  - title: netdiscover - scan with known MAC list
    desc: |
      Uses a file containing known MAC addresses and hostnames to help identify devices during the scan.
      This allows the tool to map discovered hardware addresses to specific, user-defined labels.
      It is very helpful in enterprise environments where you want to distinguish between known assets and rogue devices.
      The mapping file should follow the format required by netdiscover to ensure correct identification.
    command: "netdiscover -r {{range}} -m {{mac_file}}"
