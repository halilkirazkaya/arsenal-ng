  # === RECONNAISSANCE & ENUMERATION ===
  - title: joomscan - basic website scan
    desc: |
      Performs a basic scan of a target Joomla website to identify the version and common vulnerabilities. 
      It checks for known misconfigurations, firewall presence, and exposed sensitive files like configuration.php. 
      This should be the starting point for any Joomla-specific reconnaissance to map the basic attack surface.
    command: "joomscan --url {{url}}"

  - title: joomscan - enumerate components
    desc: |
      Attempts to discover installed Joomla components and extensions by checking common paths. 
      Since many Joomla vulnerabilities reside in third-party extensions rather than the core, this is a critical step. 
      It helps identify outdated or vulnerable plugins that can be exploited for further access.
    command: "joomscan --url {{url}} --enumerate-components"

  # === EVASION & STEALTH ===
  - title: joomscan - scan with random user-agent
    desc: |
      Executes the scan using a randomized User-Agent string for every request to bypass basic signature-based detection. 
      Security systems like WAFs often block the default JoomScan identifier to prevent automated scanning. 
      Using a random agent helps simulate traffic from various browsers, increasing the chances of staying undetected.
    command: "joomscan --url {{url}} --random-agent"

  - title: joomscan - scan with custom user-agent
    desc: |
      Specifies a fixed custom User-Agent string for all requests sent to the target server. 
      This is useful when the target environment only allows specific browsers or when you need to mimic a legitimate corporate crawler. 
      Providing a custom string allows for better control over how the scan is perceived by server logs.
    command: "joomscan --url {{url}} --user-agent \"{{user_agent|Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36}}\""

  # === AUTHENTICATION & ADVANCED CONFIGURATION ===
  - title: joomscan - scan with cookies
    desc: |
      Injects a session cookie into the scan requests to perform an authenticated vulnerability assessment. 
      This allows JoomScan to reach pages and components that are restricted to logged-in users or administrators. 
      Useful for deep-dive testing where you already have low-level credentials and want to escalate privileges.
    command: "joomscan --url {{url}} --cookie \"{{cookie_string}}\""

  - title: joomscan - scan via proxy
    desc: |
      Routes all scanning traffic through a specified proxy server such as Burp Suite or a SOCKS proxy. 
      This is essential for analyzing the tool's traffic, bypassing IP-based restrictions, or maintaining anonymity. 
      Ensure the proxy URL includes the protocol, such as http, https, or socks.
    command: "joomscan --url {{url}} --proxy {{proxy_url|http://127.0.0.1:8080}}"

  - title: joomscan - set request timeout
    desc: |
      Configures a specific timeout value in seconds for the network requests made during the scan. 
      Increasing the timeout is beneficial when scanning slow-responding servers or targets behind high-latency connections. 
      Proper timeout management prevents the scanner from dropping valid connections prematurely.
    command: "joomscan --url {{url}} --timeout {{seconds|10}}"

  # === UTILITY ===
  - title: joomscan - check version and help
    desc: |
      Displays the current version of the JoomScan tool and the help menu listing all available flags. 
      Use this to verify that the tool is correctly installed and to see if new features have been added. 
      It is a good practice to check the version before starting an engagement to ensure database signatures are up to date.
    command: "joomscan --help"
