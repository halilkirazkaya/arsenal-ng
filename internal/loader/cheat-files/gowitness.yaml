actions:
  # === BASIC SCANNING ===
  - title: gowitness - single url scan
    desc: |
      Capture a screenshot of a single specified URL using the headless Chrome engine. 
      This is the most basic command used to verify the visual state of a specific web interface. 
      The resulting image and metadata are automatically stored in the default gowitness SQLite database.
    command: "gowitness scan single --url {{url}}"

  - title: gowitness - scan from file
    desc: |
      Perform batch screenshotting by providing a text file containing a list of URLs. 
      This is highly effective during the reconnaissance phase when you have a large list of subdomains or discovered IPs. 
      The tool will iterate through the list and attempt to capture a screenshot for every valid entry.
    command: "gowitness scan file --file {{targets.txt}}"

  - title: gowitness - scan network range (cidr)
    desc: |
      Scan an entire CIDR network range to discover and screenshot active web services. 
      It automatically probes common web ports to identify reachable web servers across the network segment. 
      This is particularly useful for internal penetration tests to identify "shadow IT" or forgotten management interfaces.
    command: "gowitness scan cidr --cidr {{192.168.1.0/24}}"

  # === THIRD PARTY INTEGRATION ===
  - title: gowitness - scan from nmap xml
    desc: |
      Import and scan targets based on an existing Nmap XML output file. 
      The tool parses the XML to find open ports associated with HTTP/HTTPS services and takes screenshots of them. 
      This workflow saves time by avoiding redundant scanning of non-web ports already identified by Nmap.
    command: "gowitness scan nmap --file {{scan.xml}}"

  - title: gowitness - scan from nessus file
    desc: |
      Capture screenshots of web services identified within a Nessus scan file. 
      This helps security professionals visually validate findings and web interfaces discovered during vulnerability assessments. 
      It ensures that visual evidence is collected for all web-related assets found in the Nessus report.
    command: "gowitness scan nessus --file {{report.nessus}}"

  # === SCAN CONFIGURATION & OPTIMIZATION ===
  - title: gowitness - custom resolution
    desc: |
      Set a specific browser window size for the screenshots to simulate different devices. 
      This is helpful when testing responsive web designs or targeting mobile-specific layouts. 
      Users can define both width (X) and height (Y) to ensure the entire page content is properly captured.
    command: "gowitness scan single --url {{url}} --resolution-x {{1920}} --resolution-y {{1080}}"

  - title: gowitness - scan with delay and timeout
    desc: |
      Apply a delay before taking the screenshot and set a maximum timeout for page loads. 
      A delay is often necessary for modern Single Page Applications (SPAs) to allow JavaScript to finish rendering content. 
      Increasing the timeout helps in successfully capturing screenshots from slow-responding servers or high-latency networks.
    command: "gowitness scan single --url {{url}} --delay {{5}} --timeout {{30}}"

  - title: gowitness - multi-threaded scan
    desc: |
      Adjust the number of concurrent threads to significantly speed up large-scale scanning operations. 
      Each thread launches an instance of headless Chrome, so higher thread counts require more system memory and CPU power. 
      Monitor system resources carefully when using high thread counts to prevent the local machine from becoming unresponsive.
    command: "gowitness scan file --file {{targets.txt}} --threads {{10}}"

  - title: gowitness - scan through proxy
    desc: |
      Route all scanning traffic through a specified HTTP or SOCKS5 proxy server. 
      This is essential for bypassing network restrictions, testing from different geographic locations, or anonymizing the scan source. 
      Ensure the proxy is stable, as intermittent connections can lead to failed screenshots or timeouts.
    command: "gowitness scan single --url {{url}} --proxy {{http://127.0.0.1:8080}}"

  # === REPORTING & DATA MANAGEMENT ===
  - title: gowitness - start report server
    desc: |
      Launch a local web-based interface to view and organize all captured screenshots and metadata. 
      The report viewer provides a searchable gallery, allowing users to filter results by status code, title, or domain. 
      This is the preferred way to analyze large datasets and quickly identify interesting targets for further exploitation.
    command: "gowitness report server --address {{127.0.0.1:8080}}"

  - title: gowitness - export to csv
    desc: |
      Export the metadata from the gowitness database into a CSV file format. 
      This data includes URLs, response status codes, page titles, and file paths to the screenshots. 
      Exporting to CSV is useful for creating custom reports or importing data into other tools like Excel or specialized pentest dashboards.
    command: "gowitness report export --format csv --file {{results.csv}}"

  - title: gowitness - custom database path
    desc: |
      Specify a custom location for the SQLite database used to store scan results. 
      By default, gowitness creates a database in the current directory, but a custom path allows for better organization across different projects. 
      This is useful when you want to keep data for different clients or engagements separated.
    command: "gowitness scan file --file {{targets.txt}} --db {{/path/to/project.sqlite}}"
