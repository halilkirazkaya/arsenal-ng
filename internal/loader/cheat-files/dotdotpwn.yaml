# === HTTP & WEB FUZZING ===

 - title: dotdotpwn - basic http fuzzing
   desc: |
     Performs a standard directory traversal attack against a target web server. 
     This is the most common starting point for identifying vulnerabilities in web servers running on default ports. 
     The tool will attempt to access various sensitive files using a variety of traversal patterns.
   command: "dotdotpwn -m http -h {{host}}"

 - title: dotdotpwn - fuzzing specific URL parameter
   desc: |
     Targets a specific URL parameter by replacing its value with the TRAVERSAL keyword. 
     This is highly effective when you suspect a specific script or endpoint (like download.php?file=) is vulnerable. 
     You must explicitly include the "TRAVERSAL" string in the URL to indicate the injection point.
   command: "dotdotpwn -m http-url -u {{url|http://example.com/id.php?file=TRAVERSAL}}"

 - title: dotdotpwn - fuzzing using POST method
   desc: |
     Changes the default HTTP request method from GET to POST for the specified target. 
     Many modern applications process file paths or resource identifiers through POST data rather than URL parameters. 
     This command ensures you are testing the application's handling of data sent in the request body.
   command: "dotdotpwn -m http -h {{host}} -M POST"

 - title: dotdotpwn - search for specific file with keyword match
   desc: |
     Configures the fuzzer to look for a specific file and verify success by matching a text pattern in the response. 
     This is crucial for reducing false positives, as it ensures the content returned actually contains the expected data (e.g., "root:" in /etc/passwd). 
     It is especially useful when targets return custom error pages with a 200 OK status code.
   command: "dotdotpwn -m http-url -u {{url_with_traversal}} -f {{file|/etc/passwd}} -k {{keyword|root:}}"

# === PROTOCOL SPECIFIC FUZZING ===

 - title: dotdotpwn - ftp service fuzzing
   desc: |
     Scans an FTP server to identify directory traversal vulnerabilities that could allow escaping the home directory. 
     The module uses common FTP commands to test if the service properly restricts file access. 
     You can provide specific credentials if the server does not support anonymous login.
   command: "dotdotpwn -m ftp -h {{host}} -U {{username|anonymous}} -P {{password|anonymous@example.com}}"

 - title: dotdotpwn - tftp service fuzzing
   desc: |
     Initiates a directory traversal scan against a TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol) service. 
     TFTP is often used for booting diskless workstations or transferring configuration files and often lacks authentication. 
     Note that TFTP usually runs on UDP port 69 and might require specific firewall rules to test.
   command: "dotdotpwn -m tftp -h {{host}}"

# === ADVANCED CONFIGURATION & OPTIMIZATION ===

 - title: dotdotpwn - advanced scanning with depth and OS type
   desc: |
     Optimizes the fuzzing process by specifying the traversal depth and the target operating system. 
     Setting the OS type (windows, unix, or generic) helps the tool select the most relevant file paths to attempt. 
     Increasing the depth (e.g., to 8 or 10) allows the tool to search deeper within the file system hierarchy.
   command: "dotdotpwn -m http -h {{host}} -d {{depth|8}} -o {{os_type|unix}}"

 - title: dotdotpwn - fuzzing with Nmap OS detection
   desc: |
     Integrates with Nmap to automatically detect the target's operating system before the scan starts. 
     This ensures that the fuzzer uses the most intelligent payloads relevant to the actual target environment. 
     Be aware that this requires Nmap to be installed and might require elevated privileges (sudo) for accurate fingerprinting.
   command: "dotdotpwn -m http -h {{host}} -O"

 - title: dotdotpwn - slow fuzzing with custom delay
   desc: |
     Sets a custom time delay between each request sent to the target host. 
     Using a delay is important to avoid overloading the target server or triggering rate-limiting and Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). 
     The value is specified in milliseconds (default is 300ms).
   command: "dotdotpwn -m http -h {{host}} -t {{delay_ms|500}}"

 - title: dotdotpwn - quiet mode and report generation
   desc: |
     Runs the fuzzer in quiet mode while saving the results to a specified report file. 
     This is ideal for automated pentesting pipelines or long-running scans where you don't want to flood the terminal. 
     The resulting text file will contain all the successfully identified traversal paths.
   command: "dotdotpwn -m http -h {{host}} -q -r {{report_name|results.txt}}"

 - title: dotdotpwn - break on first vulnerability found
   desc: |
     Instructs the tool to stop the fuzzing process immediately after the first vulnerability is confirmed. 
     This is useful for quick assessments or "Proof of Concept" tasks where you only need to prove a weakness exists. 
     It saves time and reduces the number of requests sent to the target server.
   command: "dotdotpwn -m http -h {{host}} -b"
