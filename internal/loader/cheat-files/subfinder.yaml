  # === BASIC ENUMERATION ===
  - title: subfinder - basic domain scan
    desc: |
      Performs a passive subdomain discovery for a single target domain.
      This is the most common starting point for reconnaissance and attack surface mapping.
      It queries various passive online sources without sending traffic directly to the target.
      Results are displayed in the terminal with default formatting.
    command: "subfinder -d {{domain}}"

  - title: subfinder - multiple domain scan
    desc: |
      Discovers subdomains for multiple targets listed in a specific file.
      Use this when you have a large scope of domains to analyze simultaneously.
      The input file should contain one domain per line.
      This approach is highly efficient for bug bounty hunters and enterprise security audits.
    command: "subfinder -dL {{file|domains.txt}}"

  - title: subfinder - active resolution
    desc: |
      Identifies subdomains and verifies if they are currently active.
      The -active flag instructs the tool to resolve the found subdomains to ensure they point to an IP.
      This helps filter out "stale" or non-existent DNS records from the passive results.
      Note that this step involves active DNS queries, unlike the standard passive-only mode.
    command: "subfinder -d {{domain}} -active"

  # === SOURCE MANAGEMENT ===
  - title: subfinder - list available sources
    desc: |
      Displays all the passive sources currently supported by subfinder.
      Some sources require API keys to be configured in the provider-config.yaml file.
      Checking this list helps you understand where the data is coming from.
      It also indicates which sources are available for use without any additional setup.
    command: "subfinder -ls -active"

  - title: subfinder - use all sources
    desc: |
      Triggers a comprehensive scan using every available source in the library.
      This mode is slower than the default scan because it waits for responses from all providers.
      It is recommended when thoroughness is more important than speed.
      Ensure your API keys are configured for maximum efficiency when using this flag.
    command: "subfinder -d {{domain}} -all"

  - title: subfinder - specific source selection
    desc: |
      Limits the discovery process to a specific set of selected sources.
      Use this to focus on highly reliable sources like crtsh or virustotal.
      Multiple sources can be provided as a comma-separated list.
      This is useful for bypassing slow sources or focusing on specific data types.
    command: "subfinder -d {{domain}} -s {{sources|crtsh,github,censys}}"

  - title: subfinder - exclude specific sources
    desc: |
      Runs a scan while ignoring specific sources that might be slow or unreliable in your region.
      This helps in optimizing the scan time by removing problematic providers.
      It is particularly useful if a certain source is currently down or rate-limiting your IP.
      Provide the names of the sources to be skipped as a comma-separated string.
    command: "subfinder -d {{domain}} -es {{exclude_sources|google,bing}}"

  # === FILTERING & OUTPUT ===
  - title: subfinder - silent output for piping
    desc: |
      Prints only the discovered subdomains to the console without any banners or metadata.
      This is essential when piping the output to other tools like httpx, nuclei, or naabu.
      It eliminates the need for manual cleanup of the tool's output.
      Perfect for automation scripts and command-line one-liners.
    command: "subfinder -d {{domain}} -silent"

  - title: subfinder - save output to file
    desc: |
      Writes the discovery results to a specific text file for later analysis.
      This prevents the loss of data and allows for easy documentation of findings.
      If the file doesn't exist, subfinder will create it automatically.
      Useful for keeping a record of subdomains during different stages of a pentest.
    command: "subfinder -d {{domain}} -o {{output|results.txt}}"

  - title: subfinder - JSON format output
    desc: |
      Generates output in JSONL (JSON Lines) format which contains rich metadata.
      The output includes not only the subdomain but also the sources that found it.
      This is the preferred format for integrating subfinder with databases or custom parsers.
      Use this if you need to perform complex data analysis on the results.
    command: "subfinder -d {{domain}} -oJ"

  - title: subfinder - include IP addresses
    desc: |
      Displays the IP addresses associated with the discovered subdomains.
      This command automatically enables the -active flag because resolution is required to find IPs.
      It provides a more complete picture of the target's infrastructure.
      Only subdomains that successfully resolve to an IP will be included in the output.
    command: "subfinder -d {{domain}} -active -oI"

  # === PERFORMANCE & ADVANCED ===
  - title: subfinder - rate limiting
    desc: |
      Controls the speed of the scan by limiting the number of HTTP requests sent per second.
      This is important for avoiding rate-limiting or blocks from passive source providers.
      If you are using many API keys, you might want to increase this value.
      Conversely, decrease it if you are experiencing frequent timeouts or connection resets.
    command: "subfinder -d {{domain}} -rl {{limit|10}}"

  - title: subfinder - custom resolvers
    desc: |
      Specifies a list of custom DNS resolvers to use for the -active resolution phase.
      By default, subfinder uses system resolvers, but custom ones (like Google or Cloudflare) can be faster.
      You can provide a single resolver or a file containing a list of resolvers.
      This helps in bypassing local DNS restrictions and improving resolution accuracy.
    command: "subfinder -d {{domain}} -active -r {{resolvers|8.8.8.8,1.1.1.1}}"

  - title: subfinder - recursive discovery
    desc: |
      Enables recursive subdomain discovery on sources that support it.
      This allows the tool to find sub-subdomains (e.g., dev.api.example.com).
      While more comprehensive, it may increase the scan time significantly.
      Only a subset of sources handles recursive queries effectively.
    command: "subfinder -d {{domain}} -recursive"

  # === SYSTEM ===
  - title: subfinder - update tool
    desc: |
      Automatically checks for and installs the latest version of subfinder from GitHub.
      Keeping the tool updated ensures you have the latest source providers and bug fixes.
      This requires an active internet connection and write permissions to the binary path.
      It is recommended to run this periodically to maintain tool efficiency.
    command: "subfinder -up"
