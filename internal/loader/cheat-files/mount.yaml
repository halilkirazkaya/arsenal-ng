actions:
  # === BASIC OPERATIONS ===
  - title: mount - basic mount
    desc: |
      Attach a physical or logical device to a specific point in the directory tree. 
      This is the primary method for accessing external drives, partitions, or network storage. 
      Superuser privileges are typically required to perform this operation. 
      Ensure the target mount point directory exists before executing the command.
    command: "mount {{device}} {{mount_point}}"

  - title: mount - specify filesystem type
    desc: |
      Explicitly define the filesystem type of the device being mounted. 
      This is useful when the operating system fails to auto-detect the format or when using specific drivers. 
      Common types include ext4, xfs, ntfs-3g, or nfs. 
      Using the correct type prevents data corruption and mounting errors.
    command: "mount -t {{fs_type|ext4}} {{device}} {{mount_point}}"

  - title: mount - list mounted filesystems
    desc: |
      Display all currently mounted filesystems on the system along with their options. 
      This command is essential for verifying where devices are attached and what permissions they have. 
      It provides details such as the device path, mount point, filesystem type, and mount flags (ro, rw, etc.). 
      No special privileges are required to view the list of mounts.
    command: "mount"

  # === SYSTEM OPERATIONS ===
  - title: mount - mount all from fstab
    desc: |
      Mount all filesystems listed in the /etc/fstab configuration file. 
      This command is typically used after making changes to the fstab file to apply them without a system reboot. 
      It will ignore entries marked with the 'noauto' option. 
      This is a common step during system initialization or after adding new persistent storage.
    command: "mount -a"

  - title: mount - remount as read-only or read-write
    desc: |
      Change the mount options of an already attached filesystem without unmounting it first. 
      This is frequently used during system recovery to change a read-only root partition to read-write mode. 
      It can also be used to quickly lock a partition to prevent further modifications. 
      Note that some processes holding open files may prevent a successful remount.
    command: "mount -o remount,{{mode|rw}} {{mount_point}}"

  # === ADVANCED MOUNTING ===
  - title: mount - bind mount
    desc: |
      Mount an existing directory onto another directory, creating an alias in the filesystem. 
      This allows the same content to be accessible from two different locations simultaneously. 
      It is a powerful tool for configuring chroot environments or managing container volumes. 
      The contents of the target directory are hidden by the source directory until unmounted.
    command: "mount --bind {{source_dir}} {{target_dir}}"

  - title: mount - mount ISO or disk image
    desc: |
      Mount a filesystem image file using a loop device. 
      This enables you to browse and interact with the contents of an ISO file or raw disk image as if it were a physical disk. 
      This is highly useful for software installation from media images or forensic analysis of disk dumps. 
      The system automatically handles the loop device attachment in most modern distributions.
    command: "mount -o loop {{image_file}} {{mount_point}}"

  # === SECURITY & RESTRICTIONS ===
  - title: mount - security restricted mount
    desc: |
      Mount a device with specific flags to restrict the execution of binaries and the use of special files. 
      The 'noexec' flag prevents scripts and binaries from running, while 'nosuid' ignores set-user-identifier bits. 
      This is a critical hardening technique for world-writable partitions like /tmp or user-controlled media. 
      It significantly reduces the risk of privilege escalation attacks from those partitions.
    command: "mount -o noexec,nosuid,nodev {{device}} {{mount_point}}"

  - title: mount - read-only mount
    desc: |
      Mount a device in read-only mode to prevent any data modification. 
      This is the safest way to examine potentially compromised or failing hardware. 
      It ensures that no write operations, including metadata updates like access times, occur on the media. 
      This is standard practice during digital forensics and incident response.
    command: "mount -r {{device}} {{mount_point}}"

  # === NETWORK FILESYSTEMS ===
  - title: mount - mount NFS share
    desc: |
      Connect to a remote Network File System (NFS) export. 
      This allows you to access files over the network as if they were stored on your local machine. 
      You must ensure the nfs-common or nfs-utils package is installed on the client. 
      Check network connectivity and firewall settings if the connection times out.
    command: "mount -t nfs {{server_ip}}:{{remote_path}} {{mount_point}}"
