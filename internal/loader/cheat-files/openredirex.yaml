  # === BASIC USAGE ===
  - title: openredirex - basic scan with default payloads
    desc: |
      This command performs a basic scan for open redirection vulnerabilities by reading a list of URLs from a file. 
      It automatically identifies parameters in the URLs and replaces them with a hardcoded list of common redirection payloads. 
      This is the most frequent entry point for testing a large list of endpoints discovered during the reconnaissance phase.
    command: "cat {{url_list}} | openredirex"

  - title: openredirex - scan using a custom payload file
    desc: |
      Use this command when you have a specific list of payloads, such as those designed to bypass certain filters or WAFs. 
      The tool will read each line from your provided payload file and inject it into the target URLs. 
      This is highly recommended for more advanced testing where the default payload list might be insufficient.
    command: "cat {{url_list}} | openredirex -p {{payload_file}}"

  # === CONFIGURATION & OPTIMIZATION ===
  - title: openredirex - scan with a custom keyword
    desc: |
      By default, the tool looks for the string 'FUZZ' within the provided URLs to determine where to inject payloads. 
      If your URLs use a different placeholder or if you want to target a specific parameter name, use this flag to define it. 
      This ensures that the injection occurs exactly where you intend it to, providing better control over the testing process.
    command: "cat {{url_list}} | openredirex -k {{keyword|FUZZ}}"

  - title: openredirex - adjust concurrency for performance
    desc: |
      This flag controls the number of concurrent tasks the script runs, which directly impacts the speed of the scan. 
      Increasing the concurrency can drastically reduce the time needed to scan thousands of URLs, but it may also trigger rate limits. 
      The default value is 100, but you should adjust it based on the stability and speed of the target server.
    command: "cat {{url_list}} | openredirex -c {{concurrency|50}}"

  # === ADVANCED WORKFLOWS ===
  - title: openredirex - full custom scan configuration
    desc: |
      Combine multiple flags to execute a highly tailored scan against your target list. 
      This example sets a custom payload file, a specific keyword for injection, and a defined concurrency level simultaneously. 
      This is the ideal approach for professional security assessments and bug bounty hunting on large-scale infrastructures.
    command: "cat {{url_list}} | openredirex -p {{payload_file}} -k {{keyword|FUZZ}} -c {{concurrency|100}}"

  - title: openredirex - integration with url discovery tools
    desc: |
      This command demonstrates how to pipe output from discovery tools like 'waybackurls' directly into the scanner. 
      It filters the discovered URLs and immediately starts checking them for open redirection vulnerabilities. 
      Note that you may need to ensure the URLs contain the appropriate keyword or parameters before piping them.
    command: "waybackurls {{domain}} | grep '=' | openredirex -c {{concurrency|100}}"
