  # === BASIC ENUMERATION ===
  - title: cloud_enum - basic keyword enumeration
    desc: |
      Perform a standard scan across AWS, Azure, and GCP using a single keyword.
      The tool will automatically apply default mutations to find common naming conventions for buckets and services.
      This is the primary method for discovering publicly accessible storage and apps belonging to a specific company.
      It is highly effective for initial OSINT and footprinting phases during a penetration test.
    command: "cloud_enum -k {{keyword}}"

  - title: cloud_enum - multiple keyword scan
    desc: |
      Search for multiple keywords or brand names in a single execution.
      This is useful when an organization uses different names for its subsidiaries or specific project identifiers.
      Combining keywords into one command helps streamline the reconnaissance process and provides a consolidated view.
      Ensure you use the -k flag for each unique keyword you wish to target.
    command: "cloud_enum -k {{keyword1}} -k {{keyword2}} -k {{keyword3}}"

  - title: cloud_enum - enumeration using a keyword file
    desc: |
      Read a list of keywords from a text file to perform bulk cloud enumeration.
      This approach is ideal when dealing with large-scale targets or lists of subdomains harvested from other tools.
      The input file should contain one keyword per line for the tool to process correctly.
      It automates the search for a vast array of potential assets without manual input for each keyword.
    command: "cloud_enum -kf {{keyfile_path}}"

  # === ADVANCED CONFIGURATION ===
  - title: cloud_enum - quick scan without mutations
    desc: |
      Disable all keyword mutations and second-level brute-forcing to perform a rapid check.
      This is useful when you have the exact name of a resource and want to verify its existence and accessibility quickly.
      It significantly reduces the number of requests sent to cloud providers, making the scan very fast.
      Note that this will likely miss resources that follow non-standard naming patterns or use common suffixes.
    command: "cloud_enum -k {{keyword}} -qs"

  - title: cloud_enum - high performance multi-threaded scan
    desc: |
      Increase the number of threads used for HTTP brute-forcing to speed up the discovery process.
      The default is set to 5 threads, but increasing this can yield faster results on high-bandwidth connections.
      Be cautious as setting the thread count too high may trigger rate-limiting from cloud providers like AWS or Azure.
      Monitoring the output for errors or timeouts is recommended when using high thread values.
    command: "cloud_enum -k {{keyword}} -t {{threads|20}}"

  - title: cloud_enum - custom mutation and brute-force lists
    desc: |
      Specify custom files for keyword mutations and Azure container brute-forcing.
      Using a targeted wordlist instead of the default fuzzing file can significantly increase the success rate for specific industries.
      The -m flag handles general mutations, while -b is specifically used for the second-level brute-forcing of Azure resources.
      This is a powerful feature for advanced users who have developed their own specialized cloud resource wordlists.
    command: "cloud_enum -k {{keyword}} -m {{mutation_file}} -b {{brute_file}}"

  # === FILTERING AND OUTPUT ===
  - title: cloud_enum - targeted provider scan
    desc: |
      Focus the enumeration on a specific cloud provider by disabling the others.
      This command is useful when you already know the target's primary infrastructure and want to avoid unnecessary noise.
      Disabling providers like AWS or Azure saves time and reduces the number of outgoing requests during the engagement.
      You can mix and match these flags to scan exactly the environments you are interested in.
    command: "cloud_enum -k {{keyword}} --disable-aws --disable-azure"

  - title: cloud_enum - detailed logging to file
    desc: |
      Save the discovery results to a log file in a structured format like JSON or CSV.
      Logging is essential for documentation and for feeding the discovered assets into other automated tools.
      The tool appends found items to the specified file, ensuring that previous results are not accidentally overwritten.
      This allows for long-running scans to be recorded safely for later analysis or reporting.
    command: "cloud_enum -k {{keyword}} -l {{logfile|results.json}} -f {{format|json}}"

  - title: cloud_enum - custom nameserver configuration
    desc: |
      Specify a custom DNS server to be used for the brute-force and discovery process.
      This can be useful to bypass local DNS filtering or to use specialized DNS providers that may offer better performance.
      Changing the nameserver can also help in scenarios where local DNS resolvers are rate-limiting rapid queries.
      Ensure the provided nameserver is reliable to prevent false negatives during the enumeration phase.
    command: "cloud_enum -k {{keyword}} -ns {{nameserver|1.1.1.1}}"
