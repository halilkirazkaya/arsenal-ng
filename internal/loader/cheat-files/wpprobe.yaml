actions:
  # === MAINTENANCE ACTIONS ===
  - title: wpprobe - update tool
    desc: |
      Update WPProbe to the latest available version from the source.
      This ensures that you have the newest features, performance improvements, and bug fixes.
      It is highly recommended to run this command before starting any new security assessment.
    command: "wpprobe update"

  - title: wpprobe - update vulnerability database
    desc: |
      Update the local Wordfence vulnerability database used for matching.
      This database contains information about known vulnerabilities in WordPress plugins and themes.
      Regularly updating this database is crucial for the tool's accuracy in identifying security risks.
    command: "wpprobe update-db"

  # === SCANNING MODES ===
  - title: wpprobe - basic stealth scan
    desc: |
      Perform a basic scan on a single WordPress target using the default stealthy mode.
      This mode attempts to identify plugins and themes without triggering aggressive security alerts.
      It is the ideal starting point for initial reconnaissance when noise reduction is a priority.
    command: "wpprobe scan -u {{target_url}}"

  - title: wpprobe - brute-force detection scan
    desc: |
      Execute a comprehensive scan using brute-force detection techniques.
      This mode actively probes for a wide range of common plugins and themes to ensure maximum coverage.
      Note that this method is noisier and more likely to be logged by the target server's web application firewall.
    command: "wpprobe scan -u {{target_url}} --mode bruteforce"

  - title: wpprobe - hybrid mode scan
    desc: |
      Scan a WordPress site using the hybrid mode for an optimal balance of speed and stealth.
      The tool first attempts stealthy detection and then uses brute-force for the remaining unidentified components.
      This is often the most effective way to get thorough results while minimizing unnecessary requests.
    command: "wpprobe scan -u {{target_url}} --mode hybrid"

  # === ADVANCED SCANNING & OUTPUT ===
  - title: wpprobe - scan with custom plugin list
    desc: |
      Utilize a custom text file containing a list of plugins for brute-force or hybrid scanning.
      This is useful when you want to target specific plugins or use a proprietary wordlist tailored for a specific environment.
      The file should contain one plugin slug per line for the scanner to process correctly.
    command: "wpprobe scan -u {{target_url}} --mode {{mode|bruteforce}} --plugin-list {{plugin_list_path|plugins.txt}}"

  - title: wpprobe - bulk scan from file
    desc: |
      Scan multiple targets simultaneously by providing a text file containing target URLs.
      The tool can process these targets in parallel using multiple threads to significantly increase speed.
      This is the preferred method for large-scale infrastructure audits or bug bounty hunting.
    command: "wpprobe scan -f {{targets_file|targets.txt}} -t {{threads|20}}"

  - title: wpprobe - save results to file
    desc: |
      Export the discovery results to a structured file format such as JSON or CSV.
      Saving results is essential for reporting purposes and for integrating findings into other security tools.
      The tool automatically detects the desired format based on the file extension provided in the output path.
    command: "wpprobe scan -u {{target_url}} -o {{output_file|results.json}}"

  # === CONNECTIVITY ===
  - title: wpprobe - scan through proxy
    desc: |
      Route all outgoing scan traffic through a specified HTTP or HTTPS proxy server.
      This is useful for bypassing IP-based rate limiting or for monitoring the scanner's traffic through tools like Burp Suite.
      If not specified, the tool will automatically check for standard environment proxy variables.
    command: "wpprobe scan -u {{target_url}} --proxy {{proxy_url|http://127.0.0.1:8080}}"
