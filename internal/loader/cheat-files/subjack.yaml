  # === BASIC SCANNING ===
  - title: subjack - basic wordlist scan
    desc: |
      Perform a basic scan against a list of subdomains provided in a text file. This is the standard 
      method for identifying potential takeover vulnerabilities by checking CNAME records against known 
      vulnerable service fingerprints. Always ensure the wordlist is clean and contains one domain per line.
    command: "subjack -w {{wordlist}}"

  - title: subjack - scan single domain
    desc: |
      Check a specific target domain for takeover possibilities without needing a full wordlist. This 
      is useful for ad-hoc testing when a specific subdomain has been identified as suspicious during 
      manual reconnaissance. It provides a quick way to verify if the domain's CNAME points to an 
      unclaimed service.
    command: "subjack -d {{domain}}"

  # === ADVANCED CONFIGURATION ===
  - title: subjack - custom fingerprint file
    desc: |
      Specify a custom configuration file containing service signatures used for identification. Using 
      a custom fingerprints.json file allows you to detect new or private cloud services not included 
      in the default tool installation. This is critical for staying up to date with the latest 
      subdomain takeover techniques.
    command: "subjack -w {{wordlist}} -c {{config_file|/usr/share/subjack/fingerprints.json}}"

  - title: subjack - secure scan with output
    desc: |
      Force the tool to use HTTPS for all requests to increase accuracy and ensure secure communication 
      with target servers. The results are saved to a file, which will be formatted as JSON if the 
      filename ends with a .json extension. This is recommended for professional reporting and 
      automated processing of results.
    command: "subjack -w {{wordlist}} -ssl -o {{output_file|results.txt}}"

  # === PERFORMANCE & AGGRESSIVE SCANNING ===
  - title: subjack - fast concurrent scanning
    desc: |
      Increase the number of concurrent threads and adjust the timeout settings for faster scanning 
      of large datasets. This is essential for mass-reconnaissance tasks during bug bounty hunting 
      where thousands of subdomains need to be processed quickly. Be aware that very high thread 
      counts may lead to network instability or rate limiting by the target.
    command: "subjack -w {{wordlist}} -t {{threads|50}} -timeout {{timeout|10}}"

  - title: subjack - aggressive mode scanning
    desc: |
      Send requests to every URL in the provided wordlist regardless of whether a CNAME record is 
      initially identified. This "hidden gem" mode can find vulnerabilities that the default logic 
      might skip, providing a more thorough assessment of the infrastructure. Note that this will 
      generate significantly more network traffic than a standard scan.
    command: "subjack -w {{wordlist}} -a"

  # === ENUMERATION & VERBOSITY ===
  - title: subjack - check for dead records
    desc: |
      Flag the presence of dead records that still have a valid CNAME entry in the DNS configuration. 
      This mode is specifically designed to find subdomains that are pointing to services that no 
      longer exist, making them prime candidates for hijacking. It helps in identifying cleanup 
      tasks for IT administrators to improve DNS hygiene.
    command: "subjack -w {{wordlist}} -m -v"

  - title: subjack - verbose scanning
    desc: |
      Enable verbose output to display more detailed information for every request made during the 
      scanning process. This is extremely helpful for debugging why a certain domain might be failing 
      or to understand the underlying HTTP responses from the targets. Use this when you need to 
      verify the logic the tool is using for its findings.
    command: "subjack -w {{wordlist}} -v"
