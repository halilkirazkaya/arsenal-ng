  # === BASIC USAGE ===
  - title: sslscan - basic scan
    desc: |
      Perform a standard scan against a target host to identify supported SSL/TLS protocols and ciphers.
      This is the most common way to start an assessment of a server's transport layer security.
      The output provides a clear overview of preferred ciphers and potential weaknesses in the configuration.
    command: "sslscan {{target}}"

  - title: sslscan - scan specific port
    desc: |
      Scan a target on a specific port number by appending it to the hostname or IP.
      Use this when the service you are testing (like a management interface or database) is not running on the default port 443.
      This is essential for identifying SSL/TLS configurations on services like 8443 (Alt-HTTPS) or 2381 (HP Insight Management).
    command: "sslscan {{target}}:{{port|443}}"

  - title: sslscan - scan multiple targets
    desc: |
      Read a list of targets from a text file and perform scans on all of them sequentially.
      The input file should contain one host per line, and can optionally include port numbers (e.g., 192.168.1.1:443).
      This is highly effective for large-scale network audits where you need to check the security posture of an entire subnet or domain list.
    command: "sslscan --targets={{file|targets.txt}}"

  # === PROTOCOL & CIPHER ENUMERATION ===
  - title: sslscan - check specific TLS version
    desc: |
      Force the tool to only check for a specific version of the TLS protocol, such as TLS 1.2 or 1.3.
      This is useful for compliance testing when you need to verify that a server has successfully disabled older, insecure protocols like TLS 1.0 or 1.1.
      It helps in debugging specific connection issues related to protocol version mismatch.
    command: "sslscan --tls{{version|12}} {{target}}"

  - title: sslscan - list all supported TLS versions
    desc: |
      Instruct sslscan to check for all versions of the TLS protocol (1.0, 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3).
      This ensures that the scan covers the entire modern TLS spectrum while ignoring legacy SSLv2 and SSLv3 protocols.
      It is a good balance for modern security audits focused on current standards.
    command: "sslscan --tlsall {{target}}"

  - title: sslscan - show IANA cipher names
    desc: |
      Display cipher suite names using the IANA/RFC naming convention instead of the default OpenSSL names.
      This is particularly helpful when comparing results with official documentation, RFCs, or other security tools like Nmap.
      Standardizing the names makes it easier to document findings in professional penetration testing reports.
    command: "sslscan --iana-names {{target}}"

  # === CERTIFICATE ANALYSIS ===
  - title: sslscan - show full certificate chain
    desc: |
      Retrieve and display detailed information for every certificate in the server's trust chain.
      This includes the root CA, intermediate certificates, and the leaf certificate.
      Use this to identify issues with chain-of-trust, expired intermediates, or weak signature algorithms used by the CA.
    command: "sslscan --show-certificates {{target}}"

  - title: sslscan - client certificate authentication
    desc: |
      Provide a client certificate and private key to the server for mutual TLS (mTLS) authentication.
      This allows you to scan the SSL/TLS configuration of services that require a valid client certificate to establish a connection.
      The file should be in PEM or ASN1 format; ensure you have the appropriate permissions to read the key file.
    command: "sslscan --certs={{cert_file|client.pem}} --pk={{key_file|client.key}} {{target}}"

  # === VULNERABILITY & SPECIAL CHECKS ===
  - title: sslscan - check for Heartbleed and Renegotiation
    desc: |
      Scan the target specifically for the Heartbleed vulnerability (CVE-2014-0160) and secure/insecure TLS renegotiation support.
      While these checks are often enabled by default, this command ensures the audit covers these critical flaws.
      Finding these vulnerabilities can lead to immediate server compromise or session hijacking, making them high-priority items.
    command: "sslscan {{target}}"

  - title: sslscan - scan RDP services
    desc: |
      Send a Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) preamble before initiating the SSL/TLS scan.
      Standard SSL scanners often fail on RDP ports (default 3389) because they don't understand the initial protocol handshake.
      This flag allows sslscan to correctly identify the encryption used for RDP sessions on Windows servers.
    command: "sslscan --rdp {{target}}:{{port|3389}}"

  # === SERVICE SPECIFIC (STARTTLS) ===
  - title: sslscan - SMTP STARTTLS scan
    desc: |
      Perform a scan on an SMTP mail server using the STARTTLS command to upgrade a cleartext connection to a secure one.
      This is necessary because SMTP usually starts on port 25 or 587 without encryption and negotiates TLS later.
      Failing to use this flag on an SMTP server will result in a failed scan because the tool won't initiate the handshake correctly.
    command: "sslscan --starttls-smtp {{target}}:{{port|25}}"

  - title: sslscan - MySQL STARTTLS scan
    desc: |
      Initiate a TLS scan on a MySQL database server by performing the database-specific STARTTLS handshake.
      Many database configurations allow or require encrypted connections but do not use standard SSL ports.
      This action helps verify if database traffic is encrypted and if the ciphers used meet security requirements.
    command: "sslscan --starttls-mysql {{target}}:{{port|3306}}"

  # === ADVANCED & OUTPUT ===
  - title: sslscan - output to XML file
    desc: |
      Save the complete results of the scan into an XML formatted file for automated processing or archival.
      This is useful for integrating sslscan into automated CI/CD pipelines or vulnerability management systems.
      You can also use '-' as the filename to output the raw XML directly to the terminal.
    command: "sslscan --xml={{output_file|results.xml}} {{target}}"

  - title: sslscan - SNI support
    desc: |
      Specify a Server Name Indication (SNI) hostname to be sent during the TLS handshake.
      This is crucial when scanning servers that host multiple virtual domains on a single IP address (Virtual Hosting).
      Without providing the correct SNI name, the server might present the wrong certificate or refuse the connection entirely.
    command: "sslscan --sni-name={{hostname}} {{target}}"

  - title: sslscan - disable color output
    desc: |
      Run the scan without any ANSI color codes in the output.
      This is helpful when you are piping the output to other text processing tools like grep, awk, or saving to a log file for documentation.
      It prevents the "garbage" characters from appearing in plain text files.
    command: "sslscan --no-colour {{target}}"
