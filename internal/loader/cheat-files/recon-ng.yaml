# === WORKSPACE MANAGEMENT ===
 - title: recon-ng - Start with Workspace
   desc: |
     Starts the framework within a specific workspace context. This is essential for keeping data organized between different projects and clients. 
     If the workspace does not exist, recon-ng will create it automatically upon initialization. 
     Using workspaces prevents data contamination across different assessment targets.
   command: "recon-ng -w {{workspace_name|internal_audit}}"

 - title: recon-ng - List Workspaces
   desc: |
     Displays all existing workspaces within the recon-ng environment. This allows the user to see which projects have already been created and populated with data. 
     It is a helpful management command to navigate between different engagement datasets. 
     Note that switching workspaces usually happens at the start of a session or via the interactive shell.
   command: "recon-ng -C \"workspaces list\""

# === MARKETPLACE & MODULE MANAGEMENT ===
 - title: recon-ng - Search Marketplace
   desc: |
     Searches the online module repository for specific keywords to find relevant reconnaissance tools. 
     Since version 5, recon-ng uses a marketplace system where modules must be discovered and installed individually. 
     Use this to find modules for specific platforms like GitHub, Twitter, or DNS providers.
   command: "recon-ng -C \"marketplace search {{keyword|dns}}\""

 - title: recon-ng - Install Module
   desc: |
     Downloads and installs a specific module from the remote marketplace to the local framework. 
     This step is mandatory before a module can be loaded or executed in a workflow. 
     Ensure you have an active internet connection to reach the official module repository. 
     Specify the full path provided by the marketplace search command.
   command: "recon-ng -C \"marketplace install {{module_path|recon/domains-hosts/brute_hosts}}\""

 - title: recon-ng - Update All Modules
   desc: |
     Updates all currently installed modules to their latest versions from the marketplace. 
     Running this regularly ensures that you have the most up-to-date scripts and bug fixes for your reconnaissance tasks. 
     It is considered a best practice to update before starting a new engagement to avoid issues with broken APIs.
   command: "recon-ng -C \"marketplace install all\""

# === DATABASE OPERATIONS ===
 - title: recon-ng - Insert Domain
   desc: |
     Adds a target domain into the current workspace database. This serves as the primary seed or starting point for many automated reconnaissance modules. 
     Most 'recon' modules look at the 'domains' table to determine what targets to scan. 
     You should verify that you are in the correct workspace before inserting target data.
   command: "recon-ng -w {{workspace_name}} -C \"db insert domains {{domain_name|example.com}}\""

 - title: recon-ng - Show Database Table
   desc: |
     Displays the contents of a specific table within the workspace database. 
     This is used to review discovered information such as hosts, contacts, locations, or credentials. 
     It helps the tester track progress and see what information has been successfully gathered so far.
   command: "recon-ng -w {{workspace_name}} -C \"db show {{table_name|hosts}}\""

# === MODULE EXECUTION & CONFIGURATION ===
 - title: recon-ng - Run Specific Module
   desc: |
     Loads and executes a specific module against the data stored in the current workspace. 
     This is the core functional command for performing automated reconnaissance tasks like DNS brute forcing or search engine scraping. 
     The module will automatically pull relevant targets from the database based on its internal logic.
   command: "recon-ng -w {{workspace_name}} -C \"modules load {{module_path|recon/domains-hosts/google_site_web}} ; run\""

 - title: recon-ng - Set Module Options
   desc: |
     Configures specific parameters for a module before it is executed. 
     This is used to define custom wordlists, toggle verbosity, or set source requirements for the scan. 
     These options are only applied to the current module context and persist until the module is reloaded or the session ends.
   command: "recon-ng -C \"modules load {{module_path}} ; options set {{option_name|SOURCE}} {{value}} ; run\""

 - title: recon-ng - Add API Keys
   desc: |
     Stores an API key for external services like Shodan, Censys, or FullContact. 
     Many high-quality OSINT modules require these keys to interact with third-party APIs and retrieve data. 
     Keys are stored globally and are available across all workspaces once added to the framework.
   command: "recon-ng -C \"keys add {{key_name|shodan_api}} {{key_value}}\""

# === AUTOMATION & REPORTING ===
 - title: recon-ng - Execute Resource File
   desc: |
     Runs a series of recon-ng commands stored in a plain text file. 
     This is highly effective for automating repetitive workflows or setting up standardized reconnaissance pipelines. 
     It allows for consistent results and saves time by avoiding manual entry of every individual command.
   command: "recon-ng -r {{resource_file|setup.rc}}"

 - title: recon-ng - Generate HTML Report
   desc: |
     Exports the data collected in the workspace database into a structured HTML report. 
     This provides a readable summary of all discovered hosts, leaked emails, and other metadata found during the reconnaissance phase. 
     Make sure the 'reporting/html' module is installed from the marketplace before attempting to run this command.
   command: "recon-ng -w {{workspace_name}} -C \"modules load reporting/html ; options set FILENAME {{output_path|/tmp/report.html}} ; options set CUSTOMER {{customer_name}} ; run\""
