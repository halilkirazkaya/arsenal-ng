  # === BASIC SCANNING ===
  - title: dalfox - basic url scan
    desc: |
      Perform a standard XSS scan on a single target URL. This is the most common entry point for checking specific parameters for reflected XSS vulnerabilities. 
      It automatically analyzes parameters and tests for various XSS vectors using a built-in payload generator.
    command: "dalfox url {{url}}"

  - title: dalfox - scan targets from file
    desc: |
      Load a list of target URLs from a text file for batch processing. This is ideal when you have a large list of endpoints harvested from reconnaissance tools like subfinder or waybackurls. 
      Dalfox will process each URL in the list, making it highly efficient for scanning multiple targets at once.
    command: "dalfox file {{file_path}}"

  - title: dalfox - scan from stdin pipe
    desc: |
      Accept target URLs directly from standard input (stdin). This allows for seamless integration into automated command-line pipelines. 
      It is commonly used after tools that output URL lists, enabling instant scanning of discovered web assets.
    command: "echo {{url}} | dalfox pipe"

  # === REQUEST CUSTOMIZATION ===
  - title: dalfox - scan with post data
    desc: |
      Test parameters within a POST request body for XSS vulnerabilities. This is essential for testing forms, login pages, and API endpoints where data is not passed via URL parameters. 
      Ensure the data string is properly formatted as it would be sent in a real HTTP request.
    command: "dalfox url {{url}} -d {{post_data|'username=admin&id=1'}} -X POST"

  - title: dalfox - scan with custom cookies and headers
    desc: |
      Add custom HTTP headers or cookies to scan authenticated or protected areas of an application. 
      This is necessary for bypassing session-based access controls or providing required API keys during the scan. 
      Multiple headers can be added to satisfy complex authentication requirements.
    command: "dalfox url {{url}} -C {{cookie|'sessionid=abc123'}} -H {{header|'Authorization: Bearer token'}}"

  - title: dalfox - proxy support
    desc: |
      Route all scanning traffic through a specified proxy server, such as Burp Suite or OWASP ZAP. 
      This allows you to intercept, inspect, and manually manipulate the requests generated by Dalfox. 
      It is particularly useful for debugging or when working within a restricted network environment.
    command: "dalfox url {{url}} --proxy {{proxy_url|'http://127.0.0.1:8080'}}"

  # === ADVANCED SCANNING STRATEGIES ===
  - title: dalfox - blind xss testing
    desc: |
      Specify a callback URL to detect Out-of-Band (Blind) XSS vulnerabilities. 
      The tool will inject payloads that attempt to make an external request to your listener (e.g., Interactsh or XSS Hunter) if executed. 
      This is the only way to detect XSS that triggers in administrative panels or background processes not visible to the scanner.
    command: "dalfox url {{url}} -b {{callback_url}}"

  - title: dalfox - waf evasion mode
    desc: |
      Enable specialized WAF evasion techniques to bypass security filters. 
      This mode automatically slows down the scanning speed, adds delays between requests, and uses a single worker to avoid triggering rate limits. 
      It also utilizes specific payload variations designed to be less "noisy" to security appliances.
    command: "dalfox url {{url}} --waf-evasion"

  - title: dalfox - parameter mining
    desc: |
      Discover hidden or unlinked parameters using dictionary-based and DOM-based mining. 
      Hidden parameters are often overlooked during development and can be a goldmine for finding XSS. 
      You can provide a custom wordlist to better target specific application logic or frameworks.
    command: "dalfox url {{url}} --mining-dict -W {{wordlist|'params.txt'}}"

  - title: dalfox - headless dom xss verification
    desc: |
      Use a headless browser to perform deep DOM XSS testing and verify reflected findings. 
      This feature significantly reduces false positives by confirming if the injected payload actually executes in a real browser environment. 
      Note that this requires more system resources and will slow down the overall scanning process.
    command: "dalfox url {{url}} --deep-domxss --force-headless-verification"

  # === OUTPUT AND AUTOMATION ===
  - title: dalfox - save results to file
    desc: |
      Export the vulnerability findings to a file for reporting or further processing. 
      Dalfox supports multiple output formats including plain text and structured JSON. 
      JSON output is particularly useful when feeding findings into other tools or custom reporting scripts.
    command: "dalfox url {{url}} -o {{output_file|'results.json'}} --format {{format|'json'}}"

  - title: dalfox - found action trigger
    desc: |
      Execute a specific shell command or script immediately when a vulnerability is discovered. 
      This allows for real-time notifications via Slack, Discord, or Telegram webhooks. 
      It is a powerful feature for bug bounty hunters who want to be notified the moment a bug is found during a long-running scan.
    command: "dalfox url {{url}} --found-action {{command_to_run|'./notify.sh'}}"

  - title: dalfox - stored xss mode
    desc: |
      Use the stored XSS mode to test for vulnerabilities where the payload is saved on the server and executed later. 
      This mode focuses on identifying if a payload injected in one request is reflected in another response. 
      It is highly effective for testing profiles, comments, and other persistent data storage features.
    command: "dalfox sxss {{url}} {{payload_flags}}"
