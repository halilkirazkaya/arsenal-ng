actions:
# === BASIC SERVICE MANAGEMENT ===
 - title: caido-cli - basic start
   desc: |
     Starts the Caido instance with default settings. This command initiates the backend 
     and typically opens the web interface in your default browser. It is the quickest 
     way to begin a web security audit session.
   command: "caido-cli"

 - title: caido-cli - listen on specific address
   desc: |
     Configures the primary listening address and port for the Caido service. Use this 
     when you need the service to be accessible on a specific network interface, 
     such as a VPN or a local network IP. Ensure that the chosen port is not 
     already occupied by other proxy tools.
   command: "caido-cli --listen {{listen_address|127.0.0.1:8080}}"

 - title: caido-cli - headless mode
   desc: |
     Starts the Caido service without automatically opening a browser window. This is 
     ideal for remote server deployments or environments where you prefer to manually 
     navigate to the UI. It prevents unnecessary browser process overhead on the host.
   command: "caido-cli --no-open"

# === NETWORK & PROXY CONFIGURATION ===
 - title: caido-cli - separate proxy and UI listeners
   desc: |
     Defines distinct addresses for the interception proxy and the management UI. This 
     setup is useful for isolating administrative traffic from the traffic being 
     analyzed. It provides better control over network routing and access restrictions.
   command: "caido-cli --proxy-listen {{proxy_address|127.0.0.1:8081}} --ui-listen {{ui_address|127.0.0.1:8082}}"

 - title: caido-cli - invisible mode
   desc: |
     Enables invisible mode for all configured listeners. This setting is required 
     when intercepting traffic from applications that are not proxy-aware. It 
     allows Caido to function as a transparent proxy for thick-client testing.
   command: "caido-cli --invisible"

 - title: caido-cli - restrict UI domain
   desc: |
     Limits access to the Caido UI to specific allowed domains. This is a security 
     feature that helps prevent unauthorized access to the auditing toolkit. It 
     is particularly important when running Caido on a shared or public server.
   command: "caido-cli --ui-domain {{allowed_domain|localhost}}"

# === DATA & STORAGE MANAGEMENT ===
 - title: caido-cli - custom data path
   desc: |
     Specifies a custom directory for storing project data, logs, and configurations. 
     This allows you to keep your security research data on a specific partition 
     or an encrypted drive. Ensure the user running the command has full read/write 
     permissions for the path.
   command: "caido-cli --data-path {{storage_path|./caido_projects}}"

 - title: caido-cli - disable synchronization
   desc: |
     Disables the synchronization feature with the Caido cloud servers. Use this 
     option when working on highly sensitive projects where data must remain 
     strictly local. It ensures that no project metadata or history leaves the machine.
   command: "caido-cli --no-sync"

 - title: caido-cli - import custom CA certificate
   desc: |
     Imports an existing Certificate Authority (CA) certificate into Caido for 
     SSL/TLS decryption. This is useful if you have a centralized certificate 
     management system in your lab. You can also provide a password if the 
     certificate file is protected.
   command: "caido-cli --import-ca-cert {{cert_path}} --import-ca-cert-pass {{password}}"

# === SECURITY & MAINTENANCE ===
 - title: caido-cli - reset credentials
   desc: |
     Resets the instance credentials used to log into the Caido dashboard. This is a 
     high-risk command that should only be used if you have forgotten your password. 
     Be aware that this might impact your ability to access existing data if not handled properly.
   command: "caido-cli --reset-credentials"

 - title: caido-cli - enable safe mode
   desc: |
     Starts the toolkit in safe mode, which limits certain features to prevent 
     instability or crashes. This is useful for troubleshooting performance issues 
     within the application. It can help isolate whether a problem is caused by 
     custom plugins or core functionality.
   command: "caido-cli --safe"

 - title: caido-cli - debug logging
   desc: |
     Enables verbose debug logs to be recorded and displayed in the terminal. Use 
     this when you encounter unexpected behavior or errors during an audit. The 
     logs provide detailed information about network connections and internal processes.
   command: "caido-cli --debug"

 - title: caido-cli - allow guest access
   desc: |
     Configures the instance to allow logins as a guest user. This can be helpful 
     for quick demonstrations or temporary collaboration without creating full accounts. 
     Exercise caution as this lowers the security posture of your Caido instance.
   command: "caido-cli --allow-guests"
