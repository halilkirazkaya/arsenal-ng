actions:
  # === BASIC ENUMERATION ===
  - title: bbot - standard subdomain enumeration
    desc: |
      Performs a full subdomain enumeration using the predefined subdomain-enum preset.
      This command combines multiple modules to identify as many subdomains as possible for the target.
      It is the most common starting point for infrastructure reconnaissance and attack surface mapping.
    command: "bbot -t {{target}} -p subdomain-enum"

  - title: bbot - passive subdomain enumeration
    desc: |
      Conducts subdomain discovery using only passive sources without interacting directly with the target.
      It filters modules to ensure no packets are sent to the target infrastructure by requiring the passive flag.
      Use this when stealth is a priority or when you want to avoid triggering security alerts.
    command: "bbot -t {{target}} -p subdomain-enum -rf passive"

  - title: bbot - comprehensive kitchen sink scan
    desc: |
      Runs the "kitchen-sink" preset which includes subdomains, emails, cloud buckets, port scans, and nuclei.
      This is a very intensive scan that covers almost every aspect of the target's external presence.
      Be aware that this can generate significant traffic and may take a long time to complete.
    command: "bbot -t {{target}} -p kitchen-sink"

  # === WEB & SPIDER OPERATIONS ===
  - title: bbot - web spidering and crawling
    desc: |
      Crawls the target URL recursively to extract emails, secrets, and other sensitive data.
      The spider distance and depth are configurable to control how far the crawler goes from the starting point.
      This is essential for identifying hidden paths and sensitive information within web applications.
    command: "bbot -t {{url}} -p spider -c web.spider_distance={{distance|2}} web.spider_depth={{depth|2}}"

  - title: bbot - subdomain enum with screenshots
    desc: |
      Discovers subdomains and automatically takes screenshots of any active web services found.
      It utilizes the gowitness module to capture the visual state of the web applications.
      This helps researchers quickly identify interesting targets or forgotten login pages.
    command: "bbot -t {{target}} -p subdomain-enum -m gowitness -n {{scan_name|screenshot_scan}} -o {{output_path|.}}"

  - title: bbot - basic non-intrusive web scan
    desc: |
      Runs the web-basic preset which includes wappalyzer, robots.txt, and other safe modules.
      This provides a quick overview of the web technology stack and public files without aggressive probing.
      It is ideal for initial profiling of a target web server's configuration and software.
    command: "bbot -t {{target}} -p subdomain-enum web-basic"

  # === SCOPE & TARGETING ===
  - title: bbot - scan with strict scope
    desc: |
      Restricts the scan scope strictly to the provided target without including child subdomains.
      By default, BBOT includes subdomains; this flag prevents it from expanding outside the specific host.
      Use this when you are only authorized to test a single host and must avoid collateral discovery.
    command: "bbot -t {{target}} --strict-scope -p subdomain-enum"

  - title: bbot - scan with whitelist and blacklist
    desc: |
      Seeds a scan with a target but restricts active interactions to a specific whitelist.
      The blacklist parameter ensures that certain sensitive or out-of-scope assets are never touched.
      This provides granular control over the scan perimeter, which is critical for compliance and safety.
    command: "bbot -t {{target}} --whitelist {{whitelist_cidr}} --blacklist {{blacklist_domain}} -p kitchen-sink"

  - title: bbot - blacklist by regex pattern
    desc: |
      Prevents the scanner from interacting with any event or URL that matches a specific regular expression.
      This is commonly used to avoid logout links (e.g., RE:signout) or specific sensitive directories.
      The RE: prefix is required to tell BBOT to treat the string as a regular expression.
    command: "bbot -t {{target}} --blacklist \"RE:{{regex_pattern|signout}}\""

  # === ADVANCED MODULES & OUTPUT ===
  - title: bbot - cloud resource enumeration
    desc: |
      Enables all modules related to cloud discovery, such as S3 buckets and Azure tenants.
      The cloud-enum flag groups these specialized modules to find data leaks in public cloud infrastructure.
      It is highly effective for finding misconfigured storage buckets belonging to an organization.
    command: "bbot -t {{target}} -f cloud-enum"

  - title: bbot - custom scan name and output directory
    desc: |
      Specifies a custom name for the scan and a custom location for all output files.
      If the scan name is reused, BBOT will append the results to the existing files instead of overwriting.
      This helps in organizing results for different clients or recurring assessment projects.
    command: "bbot -t {{target}} -p subdomain-enum -n {{name}} -o {{path|./results}}"

  - title: bbot - increase reporting distance
    desc: |
      Displays events that are further away from the initial scope by increasing the report distance.
      By default, BBOT only shows in-scope events; distance 1 will show assets one hop away (like related IPs).
      Use this to discover related infrastructure that might not be directly linked to the target domain.
    command: "bbot -t {{target}} -p subdomain-enum -c scope.report_distance={{distance|1}}"

  # === MAINTENANCE ===
  - title: bbot - install all module dependencies
    desc: |
      Downloads and installs all external binaries and libraries required by every BBOT module.
      This uses Ansible internally to ensure the system is fully prepared for any type of scan.
      Run this when setting up a new pentest machine or VPS to avoid runtime installation delays.
    command: "bbot --install-all-deps"

  - title: bbot - list all available modules and flags
    desc: |
      Provides a comprehensive list of all installed modules, their descriptions, and associated flags.
      This is useful for discovering new modules or checking if a specific tool is available.
      You can also use this to see which modules are categorized under flags like 'deadly' or 'aggressive'.
    command: "bbot -l"
