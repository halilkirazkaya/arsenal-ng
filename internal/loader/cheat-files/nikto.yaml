# === BASIC SCANS ===

actions:
 - title: nikto - basic scan
   desc: |
     Performs a standard vulnerability scan against a target host on the default port.
     This is the most common starting point for web server reconnaissance to identify outdated software and common misconfigurations.
     It checks for over 6700 potentially dangerous files/programs and reports outdated server versions.
   command: "nikto -h {{target}}"

 - title: nikto - scan with ssl/tls
   desc: |
     Forces the use of SSL/TLS for the connection to the target server.
     This is necessary when scanning HTTPS websites or services running on port 443.
     Nikto will attempt to negotiate a secure connection before starting the vulnerability tests.
   command: "nikto -h {{target}} -ssl"

 - title: nikto - scan specific port
   desc: |
     Directs the scanner to a specific port number where the web service is running.
     This is useful for non-standard ports like 8080, 8443, or development environments.
     By default, if the port is 443, Nikto will automatically attempt to use SSL.
   command: "nikto -h {{target}} -p {{port|8080}}"

# === REPORTING AND OUTPUT ===

 - title: nikto - export results to file
   desc: |
     Saves the scan results into a specific file format for later analysis or reporting.
     Supported formats include htm, csv, json, xml, and txt.
     This is essential for documenting findings during a penetration test or security audit.
   command: "nikto -h {{target}} -o {{output_file|report.html}} -Format {{format|htm}}"

# === SCAN TUNING AND OPTIMIZATION ===

 - title: nikto - targeted tuning
   desc: |
     Runs only specific categories of tests to make the scan faster and more focused.
     Tuning options include (4) Injection, (9) SQL Injection, (a) Auth Bypass, and (b) Software Identification.
     This reduces the noise generated on the network and minimizes the risk of triggering security alerts for unrelated issues.
   command: "nikto -h {{target}} -Tuning {{tuning_options|123bde}}"

 - title: nikto - exclude specific tests
   desc: |
     Runs all available tests except for the ones specified in the tuning string using the 'x' flag.
     For example, you might want to exclude Denial of Service (6) tests to ensure server stability.
     This is a safer approach when scanning production environments where uptime is critical.
   command: "nikto -h {{target}} -Tuning x{{exclude_options|6}}"

 - title: nikto - set maximum scan time
   desc: |
     Limits the total duration of the scan to prevent it from running indefinitely.
     You can specify time in hours (h), minutes (m), or seconds (s).
     This is particularly useful in automated CI/CD pipelines or when working within strict testing windows.
   command: "nikto -h {{target}} -maxtime {{time|1h}}"

# === AUTHENTICATION AND EVASION ===

 - title: nikto - authenticated scan
   desc: |
     Performs a scan using HTTP Basic Authentication credentials.
     The format required is 'id:password' or 'id:password:realm'.
     Be cautious as incorrect credentials might trigger account lockout policies on the target system.
   command: "nikto -h {{target}} -id {{username}}:{{password}}"

 - title: nikto - ids evasion techniques
   desc: |
     Employs various encoding and request manipulation techniques to bypass Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS).
     Options include (1) Random URI encoding, (5) Fake parameters, and (8) Windows directory separators.
     Note that using multiple evasion techniques will significantly slow down the overall scan speed.
   command: "nikto -h {{target}} -evasion {{evasion_type|15}}"

 - title: nikto - use proxy
   desc: |
     Routes all scan traffic through a defined proxy server like Burp Suite or a SOCKS proxy.
     The proxy details must be configured in the nikto.conf file or passed as a command-line argument.
     This is useful for intercepting Nikto's requests for manual analysis or bypassing IP-based restrictions.
   command: "nikto -h {{target}} -useproxy http://{{proxy_ip|127.0.0.1}}:{{proxy_port|8080}}"

# === ADVANCED ENUMERATION ===

 - title: nikto - directory and user mutation
   desc: |
     Attempts to guess additional file names, directory names, or usernames via various mutation techniques.
     Mutation (3) enumerates usernames via Apache /~user requests, while (6) guesses directory names from a dictionary.
     This helps discover hidden assets or backup files that are not linked directly within the web application.
   command: "nikto -h {{target}} -mutate {{mutation_type|3,6}}"

 - title: nikto - virtual host scanning
   desc: |
     Specifies a virtual host name to be sent in the HTTP Host header.
     This is critical when the target IP address hosts multiple websites (Shared Hosting).
     Without this flag, the scanner might only test the default site associated with the IP address.
   command: "nikto -h {{target}} -vhost {{domain_name}}"

# === UTILITY ===

 - title: nikto - list plugins
   desc: |
     Lists all available plugins that Nikto can use to perform security checks.
     No actual scanning is performed when this flag is used.
     It is a good way to verify your installation and see what specific vulnerabilities Nikto is capable of detecting.
   command: "nikto -list-plugins"
