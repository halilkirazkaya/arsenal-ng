  # === BASIC NAME GENERATION ===
  - title: username-anarchy - basic single name generation
    desc: |
      Generates a wide variety of username permutations for a single individual's name. 
      This is the most common starting point during reconnaissance to identify potential login IDs for a target person.
      The output includes standard patterns like first initial followed by last name, full names, and various delimiters.
    command: "username-anarchy {{first_name}} {{last_name}}"

  - title: username-anarchy - generation from input file
    desc: |
      Processes a list of names from a file to generate usernames for multiple targets at once.
      The input file can be space, CSV, or TAB delimited and should ideally contain first and last names.
      This is highly efficient for generating bulk wordlists during an internal or external network penetration test.
    command: "username-anarchy -i {{input_file}}"

  # === AUTOMATED DISCOVERY ===
  - title: username-anarchy - auto-generate by country
    desc: |
      Automatically generates a list of likely usernames based on common names from a specific country.
      This uses datasets like PublicProfiler to create a broad dictionary of names when specific target names are unknown.
      Supported countries include 'us', 'uk', 'germany', 'france', and many others listed in the tool's help.
    command: "username-anarchy -a -c {{country|us}}"

  - title: username-anarchy - recognize username format
    desc: |
      Attempts to identify the naming convention used by an organization based on a known valid username.
      It cross-references the input against common name datasets to determine if the format is "first.last", "flast", or others.
      Use the verbose flag (-v) to see the progress and detailed analysis of the recognition process.
    command: "username-anarchy -r {{known_username}}"

  # === FORMATTING AND FILTERING ===
  - title: username-anarchy - select specific format plugins
    desc: |
      Limits the output to specific, known username formats to keep the wordlist concise and targeted.
      This is useful when you have identified the target's naming convention and want to avoid unnecessary permutations.
      Common plugins include 'flastname', 'first.l', or 'first.last'; multiple plugins can be comma-separated.
    command: "username-anarchy -f {{format_list|flastname,first.last}} {{first_name}} {{last_name}}"

  - title: username-anarchy - define custom format string
    desc: |
      Provides the ability to define a highly specific naming convention using a format string.
      This is used when the target organization utilizes a non-standard pattern that is not covered by built-in plugins.
      The format string uses identifiers like 'f' for first initial and 'last' for the full surname (e.g., 'f.last').
    command: "username-anarchy -F {{format_string|f.last}} {{first_name}} {{last_name}}"

  # === OUTPUT MODIFICATIONS ===
  - title: username-anarchy - append email domain suffix
    desc: |
      Appends a domain suffix to every generated username, essentially creating an email address list.
      This is perfect for preparing candidate lists for phishing simulations or attacking cloud services like Office 365.
      Ensure the domain provided does not include the '@' symbol as the tool handles the prefixing automatically.
    command: "username-anarchy -@ {{domain|example.com}} -i {{input_file}}"

  - title: username-anarchy - case insensitive output
    desc: |
      Controls the casing of the generated usernames, defaulting to lowercase.
      Setting the case-insensitive option to False can be useful if the target system distinguishes between uppercase and lowercase.
      By default, usernames are generated in all lowercase to match the most common Unix and Active Directory behaviors.
    command: "username-anarchy --case-insensitive {{boolean|True}} {{first_name}} {{last_name}}"

  # === ADVANCED MANIPULATION ===
  - title: username-anarchy - name substitution
    desc: |
      Enables or disables name substitutions to handle common nicknames or variations.
      When turned on, the tool may substitute names like 'Robert' with 'Bob' to catch more potential username variations.
      This increases the list size but significantly improves the chances of finding valid usernames in diverse environments.
    command: "username-anarchy -s {{state|on}} -m {{max_sub|3}} -i {{input_file}}"
