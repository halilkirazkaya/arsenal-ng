# === BASIC REPLACEMENT ===

 - title: qsreplace - replace all query values
   desc: |
     Replaces all query string parameter values in a list of URLs with a specified payload or string. 
     This is a fundamental technique for testing vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or Open Redirects across hundreds of URLs simultaneously. 
     The tool automatically filters the input to ensure that only unique combinations of host, path, and parameter keys are processed, which prevents redundant testing of the same endpoint.
   command: "qsreplace {{payload|'\" language=\"javascript\">alert(1)//'}} < {{url_list}}"

 - title: qsreplace - replace with placeholder for fuzzing
   desc: |
     Replaces all parameter values with a static placeholder like "FUZZ" or "PAYLOAD". 
     This is extremely useful when preparing a list of targets for other tools such as ffuf, nuclei, or custom bash loops. 
     It ensures that the fuzzer knows exactly where to inject its wordlist while maintaining the original URL structure.
   command: "qsreplace {{placeholder|FUZZ}} < {{url_list}}"

# === ADVANCED MODES ===

 - title: qsreplace - append to existing values
   desc: |
     Appends the user-supplied string to the end of existing query parameter values instead of overwriting them. 
     This mode is useful when the target application expects a certain data type or format (like an ID or email) to process the request, but you still want to inject a payload at the end. 
     Use the -a flag to enable this behavior for scenarios like SQL injection or parameter pollution testing.
   command: "qsreplace -a {{suffix|' AND 1=1'}} < {{url_list}}"

 - title: qsreplace - unique URL and parameter combinations
   desc: |
     Filters a list of URLs to only show unique combinations of host, path, and parameter keys without changing any values. 
     This is essentially a "de-cluttering" command that helps clean up massive lists generated by discovery tools like waybackurls or gau. 
     It is a "must-use" step in reconnaissance pipelines to reduce the number of requests sent to the target server by removing duplicates that only differ in parameter order or specific values.
   command: "qsreplace -a < {{url_list}}"

# === PIPELINE EXAMPLES ===

 - title: qsreplace - filter and test with curl
   desc: |
     Integrates qsreplace into a shell pipeline to perform live testing against discovered endpoints. 
     The command first replaces all query values with a canary string and then uses xargs to send requests with curl to check for reflections or errors. 
     Be cautious when using this on large lists, as it can generate significant traffic and potentially trigger rate-limiting or account lockouts.
   command: "qsreplace {{canary|REFLECTED_HERE}} < {{url_list}} | xargs -I {} curl -s -L {} | grep {{canary|REFLECTED_HERE}}"
