actions:
  # === RECONNAISSANCE & PORT SCANNING ===
  - title: nmapAutomator.sh - Quick Port Scan
    desc: |
      Performs a fast scan to identify open TCP ports on the target host. 
      This is the most common starting point for reconnaissance and usually completes within 15 seconds. 
      It is designed to give a quick overview of the attack surface before deeper enumeration.
    command: "nmapAutomator.sh --host {{target}} --type Port"

  - title: nmapAutomator.sh - Network Discovery
    desc: |
      Scans the local network segment to identify all live hosts. 
      This is useful when you are on a local network and need to map out available targets for further testing. 
      It uses standard host discovery techniques and typically finishes in about 15 seconds.
    command: "nmapAutomator.sh --host {{target_ip_range}} --type Network"

  - title: nmapAutomator.sh - Full 65k Port Scan
    desc: |
      Runs a comprehensive scan across the entire TCP port range from 1 to 65535. 
      After discovering open ports, it automatically performs a more thorough service detection scan on those specific ports. 
      This is highly effective for finding services running on non-standard or "hidden" ports that quick scans might miss.
    command: "nmapAutomator.sh --host {{target}} --type Full"

  # === ENUMERATION & VULNERABILITY ANALYSIS ===
  - title: nmapAutomator.sh - Service Script Scan
    desc: |
      Executes Nmap's default scripts against all identified open ports to gather service information. 
      It helps in identifying software versions and potential misconfigurations in the services found. 
      This scan provides more depth than a simple port check and usually takes around 5 minutes.
    command: "nmapAutomator.sh --host {{target}} --type Script"

  - title: nmapAutomator.sh - UDP Port Scan
    desc: |
      Performs a scan for open UDP services on the target machine. 
      Note that this action requires sudo or root privileges to craft the necessary raw packets. 
      UDP scans are essential for finding services like DNS, SNMP, or TFTP that do not use TCP.
    command: "sudo nmapAutomator.sh --host {{target}} --type UDP"

  - title: nmapAutomator.sh - Vulnerability Scan
    desc: |
      Runs specialized Nmap vulnerability scripts and checks for known CVEs against discovered services. 
      This is a vital step for identifying exploitable weaknesses automatically without manual searching. 
      The scan duration varies between 5 to 15 minutes depending on the complexity of the services.
    command: "nmapAutomator.sh --host {{target}} --type Vulns"

  - title: nmapAutomator.sh - Suggestive Reconnaissance
    desc: |
      Analyzes the target's open ports and suggests specific manual reconnaissance commands. 
      After the analysis, the script will prompt the user to automatically execute these suggested tools for further enumeration. 
      This is an excellent way to streamline the workflow by using the right tool for the right service (e.g., gobuster for web).
    command: "nmapAutomator.sh --host {{target}} --type Recon"

  # === ADVANCED USAGE & AUTOMATION ===
  - title: nmapAutomator.sh - Comprehensive All-in-One Scan
    desc: |
      Executes every available scan type sequentially for a complete profile of the target. 
      This includes network, port, script, full, UDP, and vulnerability scans in one go. 
      While it is the most thorough option, it can take up to 30 minutes to complete.
    command: "nmapAutomator.sh --host {{target}} --type All"

  - title: nmapAutomator.sh - Scan with Custom DNS and Output
    desc: |
      Runs a specific scan type while defining a custom DNS server and a dedicated output directory. 
      This is useful when the target is in a segmented network or when you need to organize results for a specific project. 
      Defining an output directory ensures that all logs and Nmap files are saved systematically.
    command: "nmapAutomator.sh --host {{target}} --type {{scan_type|Recon}} --dns {{dns_server|1.1.1.1}} --output {{output_dir|./results}}"

  - title: nmapAutomator.sh - Remote Mode Scan
    desc: |
      Executes the tool in remote mode, which is optimized for scans performed across different network segments. 
      This can help bypass certain local network limitations or timing issues. 
      Ensure you have a stable connection to the remote host or gateway before initiating this scan.
    command: "nmapAutomator.sh --host {{target}} --type {{scan_type|Basic}} --remote {{remote_mode|yes}}"
