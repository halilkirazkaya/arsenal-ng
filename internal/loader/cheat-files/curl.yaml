# === BASIC OPERATIONS ===
 - title: curl - simple GET request
   desc: |
     Performs a standard HTTP GET request to the specified URL. 
     This is the most common way to fetch resources and verify if a web server is responding. 
     The output is printed directly to the standard output (terminal). 
     It is often used for quick connectivity checks or inspecting raw HTML/JSON responses.
   command: "curl {{url}}"

 - title: curl - save output to a file
   desc: |
     Downloads the content from the URL and saves it into a local file. 
     The -o flag allows you to specify a custom filename for the saved content. 
     This is essential when downloading binaries, scripts, or large datasets that shouldn't be printed to the terminal. 
     Ensure you have write permissions in the directory where you are saving the file.
   command: "curl -o {{filename|output.txt}} {{url}}"

 - title: curl - display response headers
   desc: |
     Fetches the URL and displays only the HTTP response headers. 
     This is highly useful for debugging server configurations, identifying the web server software, and checking cookies or redirect locations. 
     Using -I triggers a HEAD request, which is faster as it does not download the body content. 
     It is a primary step in web reconnaissance to find potential vulnerabilities in header configurations.
   command: "curl -I {{url}}"

 - title: curl - verbose output for debugging
   desc: |
     Enables verbose mode to show the entire request and response flow. 
     It displays the handshake, headers sent by curl, and the headers received from the server. 
     Lines starting with '>' indicate data sent, while '<' indicates data received. 
     Use this when a request is failing and you need to see exactly what curl is doing under the hood.
   command: "curl -v {{url}}"

# === DATA TRANSFER & METHODS ===
 - title: curl - send POST request with data
   desc: |
     Sends an HTTP POST request with specific form data to the server. 
     The -d flag automatically sets the Content-Type to application/x-www-form-urlencoded. 
     This is typically used for submitting web forms or login credentials. 
     You can use multiple -d flags to send multiple key-value pairs in a single request.
   command: "curl -d \"{{key1}}={{value1}}\" -d \"{{key2}}={{value2}}\" {{url}}"

 - title: curl - send JSON data in POST
   desc: |
     Sends a POST request with a raw JSON payload. 
     You must manually set the 'Content-Type: application/json' header for the server to parse the data correctly. 
     This is the standard way to interact with modern RESTful APIs. 
     Be careful with shell quoting when writing the JSON string directly in the terminal.
   command: "curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{{json_data|{\"key\":\"value\"}}}' {{url}}"

 - title: curl - upload a file
   desc: |
     Uploads a local file to the destination server using the -T flag. 
     This typically uses the PUT method or specific protocols supported by the server like FTP or SFTP. 
     It is commonly used for transferring logs, backups, or exploit payloads to a target system. 
     Note that the remote server must be configured to accept file uploads at that specific path.
   command: "curl -T {{local_file}} {{url}}"

# === AUTHENTICATION & HEADERS ===
 - title: curl - basic authentication
   desc: |
     Authenticates against a server using the HTTP Basic Authentication scheme. 
     The -u flag takes a username and password separated by a colon. 
     Curl handles the Base64 encoding of these credentials automatically. 
     Be aware that Basic Auth is insecure over HTTP as credentials are sent in plain text; always use HTTPS.
   command: "curl -u {{username}}:{{password}} {{url}}"

 - title: curl - send custom headers
   desc: |
     Adds a custom header to the outgoing HTTP request. 
     This is frequently used to provide API keys, Bearer tokens, or to bypass simple security filters. 
     You can add multiple headers by repeating the -H flag. 
     It is essential for testing how a server reacts to non-standard or missing headers.
   command: "curl -H \"{{header_name}}: {{header_value}}\" {{url}}"

 - title: curl - set custom User-Agent
   desc: |
     Overrides the default curl User-Agent string with a custom one. 
     Many web applications block the 'curl' User-Agent to prevent automated scraping or bot activity. 
     Setting this to a common browser string (like Chrome or Firefox) can help bypass such restrictions. 
     This is a standard technique used during the initial stages of web application testing.
   command: "curl -A \"{{user_agent|Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64)}}\" {{url}}"

# === SECURITY & PROXIES ===
 - title: curl - ignore SSL certificate errors
   desc: |
     Allows curl to connect to servers with invalid or self-signed SSL certificates. 
     The -k (or --insecure) flag bypasses the certificate verification process entirely. 
     This is useful for testing internal development servers or legacy systems. 
     Warning: This makes the connection vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks; use with caution.
   command: "curl -k {{url}}"

 - title: curl - use a proxy server
   desc: |
     Routes the entire request through a specified proxy server. 
     This is vital for capturing traffic in tools like Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP, or for anonymizing the source IP. 
     The proxy can be HTTP, HTTPS, or SOCKS. 
     Ensure the proxy address and port are correct, otherwise, the connection will time out.
   command: "curl -x {{proxy_proto|http}}://{{proxy_host}}:{{proxy_port|8080}} {{url}}"

 - title: curl - use cookies from a file
   desc: |
     Sends cookies stored in a file along with the request. 
     The -b flag reads cookies from the specified file, while -c can be used to write received cookies back to a file. 
     This is necessary for maintaining sessions in multi-step web interactions. 
     The file format should be either Netscape cookie format or simple "name=value" pairs.
   command: "curl -b {{cookie_file|cookies.txt}} {{url}}"

# === ADVANCED ===
 - title: curl - follow redirects
   desc: |
     Instructs curl to follow HTTP 3xx redirects automatically. 
     By default, curl shows the redirect page content or headers but does not move to the new location. 
     The -L flag ensures you reach the final destination of a shortened or redirected URL. 
     This is critical when testing URLs that use load balancers or authentication redirects.
   command: "curl -L {{url}}"

 - title: curl - limit rate of download
   desc: |
     Limits the speed of the data transfer to a specified rate. 
     The rate can be specified in bytes, kilobytes (k), or megabytes (m). 
     This is useful to prevent curl from consuming all available bandwidth on a network. 
     It is often used when downloading large files in production environments or over slow connections.
   command: "curl --limit-rate {{rate|100k}} {{url}}"
