  # === BASIC USAGE ===
  - title: goshs - start basic server
    desc: |
      Start the web server with default settings on all interfaces. This is the most common 
      way to quickly share files in the current directory over port 8000. It provides a 
      clean web interface for browsing and downloading files.
    command: "goshs -p {{port|8000}} -d {{directory|./}}"

  - title: goshs - upload only mode
    desc: |
      Start the server in a mode that only allows file uploads. Use this when you want 
      to collect files from other users without allowing them to see or download existing 
      files in the directory. It is particularly useful for receiving exfiltrated data or 
      reports during a security assessment.
    command: "goshs -uo -p {{port|8000}} -uf {{upload_folder|./uploads}}"

  - title: goshs - silent mode without directory listing
    desc: |
      Run the server without providing a directory listing to the user. This effectively 
      hides the file structure, requiring the user to know the exact filename to download it. 
      This adds a small layer of obscurity for sensitive file transfers.
    command: "goshs -si"

  # === SECURITY AND AUTHENTICATION ===
  - title: goshs - basic authentication
    desc: |
      Secure the server using standard HTTP Basic Authentication. This requires users to 
      provide a valid username and password before they can access any content. It is 
      highly recommended when hosting the server on a public or shared network to prevent 
      unauthorized access.
    command: "goshs -b '{{username|admin}}:{{password|password123}}'"

  - title: goshs - self-signed TLS
    desc: |
      Enable encrypted communication using a self-signed SSL/TLS certificate. This 
      protects the data in transit from being sniffed on the network. Note that browsers 
      will display a certificate warning since the certificate is not signed by a 
      trusted Certificate Authority.
    command: "goshs -s -ss"

  - title: goshs - ip whitelisting
    desc: |
      Restrict access to the server so that only specific IP addresses can connect. 
      This is a powerful security feature that prevents any connection attempts from 
      unauthorized hosts. Multiple IP addresses can be provided as a comma-separated list.
    command: "goshs -ipw {{allowed_ips|127.0.0.1,192.168.1.100}}"

  # === ADVANCED PROTOCOLS ===
  - title: goshs - webdav support
    desc: |
      Enable the WebDAV protocol alongside the standard web interface. This allows 
      users to mount the server directory as a local network drive on Windows, macOS, 
      or Linux. It is very useful for managing files as if they were on a local disk 
      rather than using a browser.
    command: "goshs -w -wp {{webdav_port|8001}}"

  - title: goshs - sftp server
    desc: |
      Activate a built-in SFTP server for secure file transfers over SSH. This provides 
      a robust alternative to HTTP for users who prefer using command-line SFTP clients 
      or FileZilla. You can customize the listening port to avoid conflicts with 
      existing SSH services.
    command: "goshs -sftp -sp {{sftp_port|2022}}"

  # === AUTOMATION AND LOGGING ===
  - title: goshs - webhook notifications
    desc: |
      Configure the server to send real-time notifications to a webhook URL when 
      actions occur. This is ideal for monitoring when a file is uploaded, downloaded, 
      or deleted by a user. It supports popular providers like Discord, Slack, and 
      Mattermost for easy integration into your workflow.
    command: "goshs -W -Wu {{webhook_url}} -Wp {{provider|Discord}} -We {{events|all}}"

  - title: goshs - verbose logging to file
    desc: |
      Run the server with verbose output and redirect the logs to a specific file. 
      This is essential for auditing purposes and troubleshooting connection issues. 
      It captures detailed information about every request made to the server.
    command: "goshs -V -o > {{logfile|access.log}}"

  - title: goshs - use configuration file
    desc: |
      Start the server using a predefined YAML configuration file instead of 
      command-line arguments. This allows for complex setups to be easily reused 
      and version-controlled. You can generate a sample configuration using the 
      -P flag to see all available options.
    command: "goshs -C {{config_path|config.yaml}}"
