  # === BASIC ENUMERATION ===
  - title: wfuzz - basic directory discovery
    desc: |
      Performs a simple directory and file search against a target URL using a specified wordlist.
      The FUZZ keyword is replaced by entries from the wordlist to find hidden resources.
      This is the primary way to use Wfuzz for initial reconnaissance on a web server.
    command: "wfuzz -c -w {{wordlist|/usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt}} {{url}}/FUZZ"

  - title: wfuzz - filter by status code
    desc: |
      Hides specific HTTP response codes from the output to reduce noise.
      Using --hc (Hide Code) followed by 404 is standard practice to ignore "Not Found" responses.
      This makes it much easier to identify valid paths and restricted areas (like 200 OK or 403 Forbidden).
    command: "wfuzz -c -w {{wordlist|/usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt}} --hc {{code|404}} {{url}}/FUZZ"

  - title: wfuzz - fuzzing multiple positions
    desc: |
      Utilizes multiple wordlists to fuzz different parts of the request simultaneously.
      FUZZ is replaced by the first wordlist, and FUZ2Z is replaced by the second.
      This is particularly useful for finding files with specific extensions or testing multiple parameters.
    command: "wfuzz -c -w {{wordlist}} -w {{ext_list|/usr/share/wordlists/dirb/extensions_common.txt}} {{url}}/FUZZ.FUZ2Z"

  # === ADVANCED DISCOVERY ===
  - title: wfuzz - subdomain enumeration
    desc: |
      Discovers subdomains by fuzzing the Host header in the HTTP request.
      This technique is effective for finding virtual hosts that are not indexed by DNS but exist on the server.
      Note that you should often filter out the default response size (chars/words) of the main domain to see valid subdomains.
    command: "wfuzz -c -w {{wordlist|/usr/share/wordlists/dnsutils/subdomains-top1mil.txt}} -H \"Host: FUZZ.{domain}\" {{url}}"

  - title: wfuzz - recursive directory discovery
    desc: |
      Automatically performs discovery on subdirectories found during the initial scan.
      The -R flag defines the depth of recursion (e.g., -R 2 scans two levels deep).
      Use this carefully on large sites as it can generate a massive amount of traffic and take a long time.
    command: "wfuzz -c -w {{wordlist}} -R {{depth|2}} --hc 404 {{url}}/FUZZ"

  # === PARAMETER AND DATA FUZZING ===
  - title: wfuzz - post data fuzzing
    desc: |
      Sends fuzzed data within the body of a POST request to test for vulnerabilities or hidden parameters.
      The -d flag specifies the post data, where the FUZZ keyword marks the injection point.
      This is essential for testing login forms, search fields, and API endpoints for injections.
    command: "wfuzz -c -w {{wordlist}} -d \"{{param}}=FUZZ&submit=true\" {{url}}"

  - title: wfuzz - url parameter fuzzing
    desc: |
      Fuzzes GET parameters within the URL to find hidden variables or test for IDOR and injection.
      This is useful when you suspect an endpoint accepts more parameters than are visible in the UI.
      It helps in uncovering debugging modes (e.g., ?debug=true) or administrative overrides.
    command: "wfuzz -c -w {{wordlist}} \"{{url}}/page.php?FUZZ=test\""

  # === AUTHENTICATION AND SESSIONS ===
  - title: wfuzz - authenticated fuzzing
    desc: |
      Enables fuzzing on resources that require HTTP Basic, NTLM, or Digest authentication.
      The format is "user:pass", and you can even fuzz the credentials themselves using the FUZZ keyword.
      This allows for security testing of administrative consoles or internal developer tools.
    command: "wfuzz -c -w {{wordlist}} --basic \"{{user|admin}}:{{pass|admin}}\" {{url}}/FUZZ"

  - title: wfuzz - cookie fuzzing
    desc: |
      Injects fuzzed values into HTTP cookies using the -b flag to test for session management issues.
      It is useful for discovering insecure direct object references (IDOR) or privilege escalation through cookies.
      Multiple cookies can be set by repeating the -b flag or using a semicolon.
    command: "wfuzz -c -w {{wordlist}} -b \"sessionid=FUZZ\" -b \"user=admin\" {{url}}"

  # === PROXIES AND FILTERS ===
  - title: wfuzz - routing through a proxy
    desc: |
      Routes all Wfuzz traffic through a specified proxy, such as Burp Suite or a Tor listener.
      The format is ip:port:type (type can be HTTP, SOCKS4, or SOCKS5).
      This is crucial for analyzing fuzzer traffic in a proxy or bypassing IP-based restrictions.
    command: "wfuzz -c -w {{wordlist}} -p {{proxy|127.0.0.1:8080}} {{url}}/FUZZ"

  - title: wfuzz - filter by response content (Regex)
    desc: |
      Filters or highlights responses based on a regular expression matching the content.
      The --ss flag shows responses that contain the specified regex, while --hs hides them.
      This is highly effective for identifying specific error messages or successful exploitation indicators.
    command: "wfuzz -c -w {{wordlist}} --ss \"{{regex|root:x:0:0}}\" {{url}}/FUZZ"

  - title: wfuzz - filter by response size
    desc: |
      Hides responses based on the number of characters (--hh), words (--hw), or lines (--hl).
      This is the most common way to filter out false positives when the server returns a 200 OK for everything (custom 404 pages).
      Check the baseline response size of a non-existent page first, then use that value to filter.
    command: "wfuzz -c -w {{wordlist}} --hh {{char_count}} {{url}}/FUZZ"
