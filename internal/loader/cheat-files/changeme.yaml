actions:
  # === BASIC SCANNING ===
  - title: changeme.py - basic http scan
    desc: |
      Perform a basic scan against a single target using the default HTTP protocol.
      This command is the primary way to identify web-based administrative interfaces with default credentials.
      It is highly recommended for initial reconnaissance on local networks or web servers.
      Note that this mode only checks HTTP unless other protocols are specified.
    command: "changeme.py {{target}}"

  - title: changeme.py - scan all protocols
    desc: |
      Enable scanning for all supported protocols including HTTP, SSH, and others.
      This provides a more comprehensive security audit of the target by testing multiple services simultaneously.
      Use this when you want to ensure no common service is left with insecure default settings.
      Be aware that this may increase the network traffic and time required for the scan.
    command: "changeme.py --all {{target}}"

  - title: changeme.py - scan by device category
    desc: |
      Restrict the credential testing to a specific category of devices such as cameras or routers.
      This optimizes the scanning process by only using credentials relevant to the target device type.
      It is particularly useful when you have already identified the device type through other reconnaissance methods.
      Common categories include "camera", "printer", or "voip".
    command: "changeme.py --category {{category|camera}} {{target}}"

  # === ENUMERATION & FINGERPRINTING ===
  - title: changeme.py - fingerprint only
    desc: |
      Identify the target device or service type without attempting any credential logins.
      This is a "safe" mode that helps in mapping the network environment without the risk of account lockouts.
      Use this during the early stages of an engagement to gather information quietly.
      It returns metadata about what the tool thinks the target is based on its fingerprinting database.
    command: "changeme.py --fingerprint {{target}}"

  - title: changeme.py - dump credentials
    desc: |
      Print all the loaded credentials in the tool's database to the console.
      This is useful for verifying which default usernames and passwords the tool is currently checking.
      You can use this to manually audit the credential list or to verify if a specific vendor is covered.
      This command does not require a target as it only displays internal tool data.
    command: "changeme.py --dump"

  # === TARGETING & INTEGRATION ===
  - title: changeme.py - scan from shodan query
    desc: |
      Fetch targets directly from Shodan based on a specific search query and perform scans.
      This allows for automated identification and testing of internet-facing devices with default credentials.
      You must provide a valid Shodan API key using the --shodan_key flag for this to function.
      Use this feature responsibly as it interacts with public-facing infrastructure.
    command: "changeme.py --shodan_query \"{{query|netcam}}\" --shodan_key {{api_key}}"

  - title: changeme.py - specific protocol selection
    desc: |
      Manually specify which protocols to test against the target target.
      This is useful if you know exactly which ports are open and want to avoid unnecessary connection attempts.
      The protocols should be provided as a comma-separated list, such as "ssh,http".
      This helps in focusing the tool's resources on the most likely points of entry.
    command: "changeme.py --protocols {{protocols|ssh,http}} {{target}}"

  # === PERFORMANCE & OUTPUT ===
  - title: changeme.py - optimized multi-threaded scan
    desc: |
      Adjust the number of concurrent threads and the connection timeout for faster scanning.
      Increasing the thread count can significantly speed up scans against large subnets or multiple targets.
      Be careful not to set the threads too high, as it might cause network congestion or service instability.
      The timeout value ensures the tool doesn't hang indefinitely on unresponsive hosts.
    command: "changeme.py --threads {{threads|20}} --timeout {{timeout|5}} {{target}}"

  - title: changeme.py - export results to file
    desc: |
      Save the scan results into a structured file format for later analysis or reporting.
      The tool determines the format based on the file extension provided, supporting JSON, CSV, and HTML.
      This is essential for maintaining documentation during professional penetration tests.
      Using the --oa flag instead can generate all three formats at once.
    command: "changeme.py --output {{filename|results.json}} {{target}}"

  - title: changeme.py - resume previous scan
    desc: |
      Continue a scan that was previously interrupted or stopped.
      This uses the internal state to avoid re-scanning targets that have already been processed.
      It is highly recommended for long-running tasks on large network ranges or slow connections.
      Ensure you are running the command from the same environment where the initial scan started.
    command: "changeme.py --resume {{target}}"
