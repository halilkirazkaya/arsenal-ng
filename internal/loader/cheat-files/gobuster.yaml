  # === DIRECTORY AND FILE ENUMERATION ===
  - title: gobuster - basic directory discovery
    desc: |
      Perform a standard directory brute-force attack against a target URL.
      This is the most common use case for finding hidden paths, admin panels, or configuration folders.
      It uses the 'dir' mode and requires a wordlist to iterate through potential directory names.
      Ensure you have a reliable wordlist like those found in SecLists or Dirbuster.
    command: "gobuster dir -u {{url}} -w {{wordlist|/usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt}}"

  - title: gobuster - search for specific file extensions
    desc: |
      Search for both directories and files with specific extensions simultaneously.
      This is highly effective for finding source code files, backups, or configuration files (e.g., .php, .bak, .zip).
      The -x flag appends the extensions to every word in the wordlist.
      It helps identify the technology stack and potential sensitive data leaks.
    command: "gobuster dir -u {{url}} -w {{wordlist}} -x {{extensions|php,html,txt,bak,zip}}"

  - title: gobuster - directory scan with status code filtering
    desc: |
      Filter the output based on HTTP status codes to reduce noise.
      Use the -b (blacklisted) flag to hide specific codes like 404 or 403, or -s (positive) to only show successes.
      This is crucial when a server returns a 200 OK for every request or when you want to ignore forbidden areas.
      It makes the results much cleaner and easier to analyze during a time-sensitive engagement.
    command: "gobuster dir -u {{url}} -w {{wordlist}} -b {{status_codes|404,403}}"

  - title: gobuster - authenticated directory scan
    desc: |
      Perform directory enumeration while authenticated using HTTP Basic Auth.
      The -U and -P flags allow you to provide credentials for protected areas of the site.
      This is necessary when the target has a 'dev' or 'staging' area behind a login prompt.
      Failure to provide credentials usually results in 401 Unauthorized responses for all paths.
    command: "gobuster dir -u {{url}} -w {{wordlist}} -U {{username}} -P {{password}}"

  - title: gobuster - recursive directory scanning
    desc: |
      Automatically scan newly discovered directories in a recursive manner.
      This is useful for deeply nested web applications where manual follow-up would be tedious.
      Use the --depth flag to limit how deep the recursion should go to avoid infinite loops or massive scan times.
      Be cautious as this significantly increases the number of requests sent to the server.
    command: "gobuster dir -u {{url}} -w {{wordlist}} --recursive --depth {{depth|2}}"

  # === DNS SUBDOMAIN ENUMERATION ===
  - title: gobuster - dns subdomain enumeration
    desc: |
      Brute-force subdomains for a specific target domain using the 'dns' mode.
      This helps map the external attack surface of an organization by finding hidden sub-environments.
      It relies on DNS resolution rather than HTTP requests, making it useful for finding non-web assets.
      Always use a high-quality subdomain wordlist for better results.
    command: "gobuster dns -d {{domain}} -w {{wordlist|/usr/share/wordlists/dirb/subdomains-top1mil-5000.txt}}"

  - title: gobuster - dns scan with wildcard handling
    desc: |
      Perform a DNS scan while ignoring domains that resolve to a specific 'wildcard' IP address.
      Many organizations use wildcard DNS records, which can lead to many false positives in a standard scan.
      Gobuster can automatically detect wildcards, but you can also manually specify IPs to ignore.
      This ensures that the results only contain valid, uniquely configured subdomains.
    command: "gobuster dns -d {{domain}} -w {{wordlist}} -i"

  # === VIRTUAL HOST ENUMERATION ===
  - title: gobuster - virtual host (VHOST) discovery
    desc: |
      Identify virtual hosts on a web server by brute-forcing the 'Host' header.
      This is different from DNS enumeration because it checks if the server responds differently to different Host headers on the same IP.
      It is essential for discovering sites that are hosted on the same infrastructure but not publicly indexed in DNS.
      Usually, you should point the URL to the direct IP address of the target server.
    command: "gobuster vhost -u {{url}} -w {{wordlist}}"

  # === CLOUD BUCKET ENUMERATION ===
  - title: gobuster - amazon s3 bucket enumeration
    desc: |
      Search for open or existing Amazon S3 buckets using a wordlist of potential bucket names.
      This is a common method for finding leaked data, backups, or publicly accessible assets in the cloud.
      It checks for bucket existence and tries to determine if the bucket is publicly listable.
      Cloud security misconfigurations are a high-impact finding in modern pentesting.
    command: "gobuster s3 -w {{wordlist}}"

  - title: gobuster - google cloud storage (GCS) enumeration
    desc: |
      Search for publicly accessible Google Cloud Storage buckets.
      Similar to the S3 module, it uses a wordlist to find bucket names that might belong to the target organization.
      This is part of the 'gcs' command suite in newer Gobuster versions.
      It is highly effective for identifying shadow IT or forgotten cloud resources.
    command: "gobuster gcs -w {{wordlist}}"

  # === FUZZING AND OTHER MODES ===
  - title: gobuster - custom fuzzing mode
    desc: |
      Use the 'fuzz' mode to replace the 'FUZZ' keyword in a URL, Header, or Request Body.
      This provides the most flexibility, allowing you to brute-force parameters, headers, or specific URL parts.
      It is a lighter alternative to tools like ffuf or Burp Intruder for simple fuzzing tasks.
      Great for testing API endpoints or specific query string parameters.
    command: "gobuster fuzz -u {{url}}/index.php?id=FUZZ -w {{wordlist}}"

  - title: gobuster - tftp server enumeration
    desc: |
      Brute-force filenames on a TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol) server.
      TFTP does not provide a way to list files, so you must guess the filenames to download them.
      This is common in internal network assessments involving VoIP phones, routers, or PXE boot servers.
      Finding configuration files via TFTP can often lead to credential disclosure.
    command: "gobuster tftp -s {{server_ip}} -w {{wordlist}}"
