  # === RECONNAISSANCE & ANALYSIS ===
  - title: responder - analyze mode
    desc: |
      Analyze mode allows you to see NBT-NS, BROWSER, and LLMNR requests without actively responding to them. 
      This is a passive reconnaissance step used to identify if there is any vulnerable traffic on the network.
      It is highly recommended to run this first to avoid detection and understand the network dynamics.
      No hashes will be captured in this mode as it does not poison the requests.
    command: "responder -I {{interface|eth0}} -A"

  # === CORE POISONING ACTIONS ===
  - title: responder - basic poisoning
    desc: |
      Starts the default poisoning process for LLMNR, NBT-NS, and MDNS protocols. 
      This is the most common usage of the tool to capture NTLMv1/v2 hashes from network clients.
      The tool will automatically start various servers like SMB, HTTP, and SQL to collect credentials.
      Ensure you are running this in an environment where you have permission, as it can be disruptive.
    command: "responder -I {{interface|eth0}}"

  - title: responder - basic poisoning with verbosity
    desc: |
      Runs the standard poisoning modules with increased verbosity to see more detailed output.
      This is helpful for troubleshooting connection issues or seeing specific request details from targets.
      It helps in identifying which specific protocol (e.g., SMB vs HTTP) a target is using to communicate.
      The verbose mode provides real-time feedback on every packet intercepted and processed.
    command: "responder -I {{interface|eth0}} -v"

  # === WPAD & PROXY EXPLOITATION ===
  - title: responder - wpad exploitation
    desc: |
      Starts a rogue WPAD (Web Proxy Auto-Discovery) server to intercept web traffic.
      When clients attempt to discover proxy settings, Responder will provide a malicious wpad.dat file.
      This directs the client's web traffic through the attacker's machine for credential harvesting.
      This is one of the most effective ways to capture credentials from modern Windows environments.
    command: "responder -I {{interface|eth0}} -w"

  - title: responder - force wpad authentication
    desc: |
      Forces NTLM or Basic authentication when a target attempts to retrieve the wpad.dat file.
      While this may cause a login prompt to appear on the victim's machine, it significantly increases the chance of hash capture.
      Use this when standard WPAD poisoning is not yielding results.
      Be aware that a login prompt might alert more technically savvy users to the attack.
    command: "responder -I {{interface|eth0}} -wF"

  - title: responder - force proxy authentication
    desc: |
      Forces NTLM (transparently) or Basic (via prompt) authentication for the rogue proxy.
      This option is highly effective because it doesn't strictly require the WPAD server to be active.
      It intercepts proxy-aware applications and forces them to authenticate against the attacker.
      Note that this can be very intrusive and might break internet connectivity for the victim if handled improperly.
    command: "responder -I {{interface|eth0}} -P"

  # === DHCP EXPLOITATION ===
  - title: responder - dhcp poisoning
    desc: |
      Enables answers for DHCP broadcast requests to inject a rogue WPAD server in the DHCP response.
      This is a powerful technique that works even if LLMNR or NBT-NS are disabled on the network.
      By becoming the "DHCP server" for a moment, you can tell the client exactly where to look for proxy settings.
      Requires the attacker to be on the same broadcast domain as the victim requesting an IP.
    command: "responder -I {{interface|eth0}} -d"

  - title: responder - dhcp dns poisoning
    desc: |
      Injects a rogue DNS server address into the DHCP response instead of a WPAD server.
      This can allow for further DNS spoofing attacks against the target machine.
      It is an alternative to the standard DHCP WPAD injection method.
      Use this when you want to redirect all DNS queries from the target to a controlled DNS server.
    command: "responder -I {{interface|eth0}} -D"

  # === ADVANCED CONFIGURATIONS ===
  - title: responder - use external ip redirection
    desc: |
      Tells Responder to poison requests with a specific external IP address rather than its own interface IP.
      This is useful when the attacker's machine is behind a NAT or when traffic needs to be redirected to a different server.
      Ensure the external IP provided is reachable by the victims on the network.
      It is commonly used in complex pivoting scenarios during internal engagements.
    command: "responder -I {{interface|eth0}} -e {{external_ip}}"

  - title: responder - force lm hashing downgrade
    desc: |
      Forces a downgrade to the older and much weaker LM (LAN Manager) hashing for Windows XP/2003 and earlier.
      LM hashes are significantly easier to crack than modern NTLMv2 hashes.
      This is generally only useful in legacy environments where old Windows versions are still in use.
      Modern Windows systems will typically ignore this downgrade attempt due to security policies.
    command: "responder -I {{interface|eth0}} --lm"

  - title: responder - webdav authentication prompt
    desc: |
      Changes the SMB error code to STATUS_LOGON_FAILURE to trigger WebDAV authentications.
      By default, Responder returns ACCESS_DENIED, but some services like WebClient require a logon failure to prompt.
      This is particularly useful for capturing hashes from the Windows WebClient service.
      It can help bypass certain SMB signing requirements by forcing the client to use HTTP-based WebDAV.
    command: "responder -I {{interface|eth0}} -E"
