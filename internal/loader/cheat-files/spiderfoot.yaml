  # === BASIC SCANNING & USE CASES ===
  - title: spiderfoot - passive osint scan
    desc: |
      Perform a passive scan to gather intelligence without directly interacting with the target. 
      This mode is ideal for stealthy reconnaissance as it only queries third-party databases, search engines, and public records. 
      Use this when you want to avoid appearing in the target's web server or security logs.
    command: "sf.py -s {{target}} -u passive"

  - title: spiderfoot - footprinting scan
    desc: |
      Run a footprinting scan to understand what the target exposes to the internet. 
      This use case focuses on identifying subdomains, IP addresses, and web technologies associated with the target. 
      It is a balanced approach that provides a broad overview of the target's digital footprint.
    command: "sf.py -s {{target}} -u footprint"

  - title: spiderfoot - investigate scan
    desc: |
      Execute an investigation scan which is typically used when you have a specific indicator of compromise or a suspicious target. 
      This mode is more intensive than a passive scan and tries to find deeper links between data points. 
      Be aware that this might involve more active modules that could be detected by the target.
    command: "sf.py -s {{target}} -u investigate"

  - title: spiderfoot - all modules scan
    desc: |
      Run a comprehensive scan using every available module in the SpiderFoot library. 
      This is the most "noisy" and time-consuming scan type as it triggers all active and passive checks. 
      It is recommended only when you have explicit permission and require a complete data dump of all possible associations.
    command: "sf.py -s {{target}} -u all"

  # === MODULE & DATA FILTERING ===
  - title: spiderfoot - list available modules
    desc: |
      Display a complete list of all modules currently installed in your SpiderFoot environment. 
      This helps you identify which modules require API keys and which are ready to use out of the box. 
      Reviewing this list is essential for troubleshooting missing data or configuring custom scans.
    command: "sf.py -M"

  - title: spiderfoot - run specific modules
    desc: |
      Execute a scan using only a specific set of comma-separated modules. 
      This is highly efficient when you only need data from specific sources, such as Shodan, HaveIBeenPwned, or GitHub. 
      It reduces scan time significantly and prevents unnecessary API credit consumption.
    command: "sf.py -s {{target}} -m {{modules|s3bucket,google_maps,github}}"

  - title: spiderfoot - collect specific event types
    desc: |
      Launch a scan targeted at retrieving specific data types regardless of the module used. 
      For example, you can request only 'EMAILADDR' or 'PHONE_NUMBER' to filter out infrastructure data. 
      SpiderFoot will automatically enable the modules required to produce those specific event types.
    command: "sf.py -s {{target}} -t {{event_types|EMAILADDR,BITCOIN_ADDRESS}}"

  - title: spiderfoot - strict mode scan
    desc: |
      Enable strict mode to ensure that only modules capable of directly consuming the target type are used. 
      This prevents the tool from branching out into secondary or tertiary data types that might be irrelevant. 
      It is useful for keeping the scan focused and preventing the "spidering" effect from becoming unmanageable.
    command: "sf.py -s {{target}} -x"

  # === OUTPUT & FORMATTING ===
  - title: spiderfoot - export results to csv
    desc: |
      Run a scan and export the results directly into a CSV file for external analysis. 
      This is useful for importing OSINT data into spreadsheets or other reporting tools. 
      You can define a custom delimiter if the default comma is not suitable for your data processing pipeline.
    command: "sf.py -s {{target}} -u passive -o csv > {{output_file|results.csv}}"

  - title: spiderfoot - json output with source data
    desc: |
      Generate scan results in JSON format while including the raw source data field. 
      JSON output is ideal for automation and integrating SpiderFoot results into other security platforms (SOAR/SIEM). 
      The inclusion of source data allows you to verify the evidence behind each finding.
    command: "sf.py -s {{target}} -u footprint -o json -r"

  # === SERVER & INTERFACE ===
  - title: spiderfoot - start web interface
    desc: |
      Launch the SpiderFoot web-based GUI on a specific IP address and port. 
      The web interface provides a much more visual experience, including node graphs and easy configuration of API keys. 
      By default, it listens on 127.0.0.1:5001, but you can change this to allow remote access (ensure firewall rules are in place).
    command: "sf.py -l {{ip_address|127.0.0.1}}:{{port|5001}}"

  # === ADVANCED OPERATIONS ===
  - title: spiderfoot - correlate scan results
    desc: |
      Apply correlation rules to an existing scan ID to identify meaningful patterns or high-risk findings. 
      Correlation helps filter the "noise" by highlighting connections like 'Malicious IP found in DNS records'. 
      You must have the Scan ID from a previously completed or running scan to use this feature.
    command: "sf.py -C {{scan_id}}"

  - title: spiderfoot - limit concurrent threads
    desc: |
      Manually set the maximum number of modules to run concurrently during a scan. 
      Reducing the thread count can prevent your IP from being rate-limited by third-party services. 
      Increasing it can speed up scans if you have a high-performance machine and stable network connection.
    command: "sf.py -s {{target}} -u all -max-threads {{thread_count|10}}"
