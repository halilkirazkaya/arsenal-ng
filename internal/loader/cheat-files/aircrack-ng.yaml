# === INTERFACE MANAGEMENT ===

 - title: airmon-ng - check and kill interfering processes
   desc: |
     Identifies and terminates background processes that could interfere with the wireless card's monitor mode.
     Processes like NetworkManager, dhclient, and wpa_supplicant often try to manage the interface, causing issues during packet injection.
     Running this command is a highly recommended first step before starting any wireless assessment to ensure stability.
   command: "airmon-ng check kill"

 - title: airmon-ng - start monitor mode
   desc: |
     Enables monitor mode on a specific wireless interface, allowing the card to listen to all traffic on a channel.
     The command usually creates a new logical interface named with a 'mon' suffix (e.g., wlan0mon).
     You can optionally specify a channel to lock the interface to that frequency immediately.
   command: "airmon-ng start {{interface|wlan0}} {{channel}}"

 - title: airmon-ng - stop monitor mode
   desc: |
     Disables monitor mode and returns the wireless interface to managed mode.
     This is used to clean up after an assessment or to restore standard network connectivity.
     It removes the monitor mode virtual interface and re-enables the original hardware interface state.
   command: "airmon-ng stop {{interface|wlan0mon}}"

# === RECONNAISSANCE & CAPTURE ===

 - title: airodump-ng - general network scanning
   desc: |
     Performs a wide-area scan of all nearby access points and connected stations.
     It displays critical information such as BSSID, signal strength (PWR), beacons, data packets, channel, and encryption type.
     This tool is essential for identifying targets and seeing which clients are associated with which networks.
   command: "airodump-ng {{interface|wlan0mon}}"

 - title: airodump-ng - targeted handshake capture
   desc: |
     Focuses the capture on a specific Access Point (BSSID) on a single channel to capture the WPA/WPA2 4-way handshake.
     Limiting the scan to one channel increases the probability of capturing the handshake frames without missing them due to channel hopping.
     The captured data is saved to a file prefix, which will generate several files including a .cap file used for cracking.
   command: "airodump-ng -c {{channel}} --bssid {{bssid}} -w {{file_prefix}} {{interface|wlan0mon}}"

 - title: airodump-ng - manufacturer lookup
   desc: |
     Displays the manufacturer of the Access Points and Stations based on the IEEE OUI list.
     This helps identify the type of hardware being used (e.g., Cisco, Apple, TP-Link) which can be useful for tailoring attacks.
     Ensure you run airodump-ng-oui-update periodically to keep the manufacturer database current.
   command: "airodump-ng --manufacturer {{interface|wlan0mon}}"

# === ATTACK & INJECTION ===

 - title: aireplay-ng - injection test
   desc: |
     Tests the wireless card's ability to inject packets into the air and determines the response rate from nearby APs.
     A successful injection test is mandatory before attempting more complex attacks like deauthentication or ARP replay.
     It provides a percentage of successfully received responses, indicating the quality of the connection.
   command: "aireplay-ng -9 {{interface|wlan0mon}}"

 - title: aireplay-ng - deauthentication attack
   desc: |
     Sends deauthentication frames to one or more clients associated with an Access Point.
     This forces the clients to disconnect and attempt to reconnect, which allows airodump-ng to capture the 4-way handshake.
     Be careful as this causes a service disruption for the target; always ensure you have permission before use.
   command: "aireplay-ng -0 {{count|5}} -a {{bssid}} -c {{client_mac}} {{interface|wlan0mon}}"

 - title: aireplay-ng - fake authentication
   desc: |
     Performs a fake authentication with an Access Point to allow further packet injection.
     This is primarily used in WEP attacks where you need an associated MAC address to inject packets, but no real clients are connected.
     It does not actually "crack" the password but tricks the AP into thinking a client is successfully connected.
   command: "aireplay-ng -1 0 -e {{essid}} -a {{bssid}} -h {{my_mac}} {{interface|wlan0mon}}"

 - title: aireplay-ng - ARP request replay
   desc: |
     Listens for an ARP packet and then replays it back to the Access Point to generate new IVs (Initialization Vectors).
     This is the classic method for speeding up WEP cracking by forcing the AP to produce many encrypted packets quickly.
     You typically need thousands of IVs to successfully crack a WEP key.
   command: "aireplay-ng -3 -b {{bssid}} -h {{my_mac}} {{interface|wlan0mon}}"

# === CRACKING ===

 - title: aircrack-ng - crack WPA/WPA2 with wordlist
   desc: |
     Attempts to find the pre-shared key (PSK) of a WPA/WPA2 network using a dictionary attack.
     The tool requires a capture file containing a valid 4-way handshake and a high-quality wordlist.
     Performance depends on CPU speed, but can be significantly boosted using pre-computed PMK databases.
   command: "aircrack-ng -w {{wordlist|/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt}} -b {{bssid}} {{capture_file.cap}}"

 - title: aircrack-ng - crack WEP key
   desc: |
     Analyzes captured Initialization Vectors (IVs) to statistically determine the WEP key.
     Unlike WPA, WEP cracking does not require a wordlist as it exploits mathematical vulnerabilities in the RC4 cipher.
     The more IVs you capture using aireplay-ng, the higher the chance of a successful crack.
   command: "aircrack-ng -b {{bssid}} {{capture_file.cap}}"

# === ADVANCED UTILITIES ===

 - title: airbase-ng - create fake access point
   desc: |
     Simulates an Access Point to perform Evil Twin attacks or "Caffe Latte" attacks against clients.
     It creates a virtual tunnel interface (at0) which can be used to redirect traffic or serve as a gateway for MITM attacks.
     This tool is highly versatile for attacking wireless clients rather than the infrastructure itself.
   command: "airbase-ng -e {{essid}} -c {{channel}} {{interface|wlan0mon}}"

 - title: airolib-ng - pre-calculate PMK database
   desc: |
     Manages a database of ESSIDs and passwords to pre-calculate Pairwise Master Keys (PMKs).
     Pre-calculating PMKs allows aircrack-ng to process thousands of passwords per second during a WPA attack, as the heavy computation is done beforehand.
     This is a three-step process: import ESSIDs, import passwords, and then run the batch calculation.
   command: "airolib-ng {{db_name}} --batch"

 - title: wpaclean - clean pcap for cracking
   desc: |
     Extracts only the essential 4-way handshake packets from a large pcap file and removes all other traffic.
     This results in a much smaller file size, making it easier to share or upload to cloud cracking services.
     It is a best practice to clean capture files before starting long brute-force sessions.
   command: "wpaclean {{output.cap}} {{input.cap}}"

 - title: airdecap-ng - decrypt capture files
   desc: |
     Decrypts WEP, WPA, or WPA2 capture files once the key or passphrase is known.
     This allows you to view the actual network traffic (HTTP, DNS, etc.) inside a pcap analyzer like Wireshark.
     It creates a new file with a '-dec' suffix containing the decrypted packets.
   command: "airdecap-ng -e {{essid}} -p {{passphrase}} {{capture_file.cap}}"

 - title: besside-ng - automated WPA handshake capture
   desc: |
     An automated tool that attempts to deauthenticate all nearby clients and capture WPA handshakes without user intervention.
     It is extremely effective for "war-driving" or rapid assessment of multiple networks in range.
     The handshakes are automatically saved to a file named 'wpa.cap' in the working directory.
   command: "besside-ng -W {{interface|wlan0mon}}"

 - title: airgraph-ng - visualize network relationships
   desc: |
     Generates a visual graph (PNG) showing the relationships between Access Points and Clients from an airodump-ng CSV file.
     It helps in identifying which clients are probing for which networks and the overall structure of the wireless environment.
     Supports two types of graphs: CAPR (Client to AP Relationship) and CPG (Common Probe Graph).
   command: "airgraph-ng -i {{airodump_csv}} -o {{output_image.png}} -g CAPR"
