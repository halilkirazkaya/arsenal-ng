actions:
  # === RECONNAISSANCE & DOMAIN ENUMERATION ===
  - title: dmitry - Whois lookup on IP address
    desc: |
      Perform a Whois lookup on the specific IP address of a target host. This helps identify the 
      owner of the network block and related contact information. It is useful during the early 
      stages of reconnaissance to determine the scope of the target's infrastructure.
    command: "dmitry -i {{target_host}}"

  - title: dmitry - Whois lookup on domain name
    desc: |
      Perform a Whois lookup on the domain name of the target. This provides information regarding 
      registration dates, name servers, and registrar details. It is a standard procedure for 
      identifying domain ownership and potential administrative contacts for the organization.
    command: "dmitry -w {{target_domain}}"

  - title: dmitry - Retrieve Netcraft information
    desc: |
      Retrieve information about a host from Netcraft.com to identify server details. This can 
      reveal details about the operating system, web server software, and the hosting history 
      of the domain. It is particularly useful for identifying the underlying technology stack 
      of a web-based target without active scanning.
    command: "dmitry -n {{target_host}}"

  - title: dmitry - Search for subdomains
    desc: |
      Search for possible subdomains associated with the target domain. Identifying subdomains 
      is crucial for expanding the attack surface and finding less secure staging or internal 
      environments. This module queries public records and search engines to find valid hostnames 
      belonging to the target.
    command: "dmitry -s {{target_domain}}"

  - title: dmitry - Search for email addresses
    desc: |
      Search for possible email addresses related to the target domain through public sources. 
      This can be used for social engineering assessments or identifying key personnel within 
      an organization. It aggregates results found through various search methods and displays 
      them in a simple list.
    command: "dmitry -e {{target_domain}}"

  # === PORT SCANNING ===
  - title: dmitry - Standard TCP port scan
    desc: |
      Perform a basic TCP port scan on the target host to identify open services. This is a 
      lightweight scanning method used to quickly find active services on a remote machine. 
      Note that this is not as stealthy or comprehensive as Nmap but serves well for a 
      fast, integrated discovery phase.
    command: "dmitry -p {{target_host}}"

  - title: dmitry - Port scan with banner grabbing
    desc: |
      Execute a TCP port scan while also retrieving service banners and reporting filtered ports. 
      Banner grabbing helps identify specific software versions running on open ports, which is 
      essential for vulnerability research. Including the filtered flag (-f) provides a more 
      complete view of the target's firewall configuration.
    command: "dmitry -p -b -f {{target_host}}"

  - title: dmitry - Port scan with custom TTL
    desc: |
      Perform a TCP port scan while specifying a custom Time-To-Live (TTL) value for the scan packets. 
      The default TTL is 2 seconds, but increasing it can help maintain accuracy in high-latency 
      environments. Adjusting this value can prevent scan timeouts when the network connection 
      to the target is slow or unstable.
    command: "dmitry -p -t {{ttl_seconds|5}} {{target_host}}"

  # === COMPREHENSIVE SCANNING ===
  - title: dmitry - Full information gathering scan
    desc: |
      Combine multiple modules to perform a comprehensive information gathering scan on a target host. 
      This single command includes Whois lookups, Netcraft data, subdomain discovery, and email 
      searches. It provides a broad overview of the target's digital footprint in a single execution 
      to save time during the reconnaissance phase.
    command: "dmitry -winse {{target_host}}"

  # === OUTPUT MANAGEMENT ===
  - title: dmitry - Save scan results to file
    desc: |
      Save the output of the information gathering scan to a text file for later analysis. 
      If a filename is not explicitly specified, the tool defaults to a naming convention 
      based on the host name. This is an essential step for documentation and reporting 
      during a professional penetration testing engagement.
    command: "dmitry -o {{output_file|results.txt}} {{target_host}}"
