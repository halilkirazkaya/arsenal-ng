# === BASIC ENUMERATION (SNMP v1/v2c) ===

 - title: snmpwalk - basic walk v2c
   desc: |
     Perform a recursive SNMP query starting from the root OID using SNMP version 2c. 
     This is the most common method to enumerate system information, network interfaces, and running processes on a device. 
     Ensure you have the correct community string, as 'public' is the most frequent default but may be restricted or disabled.
   command: "snmpwalk -v 2c -c {{community|public}} {{target}}"

 - title: snmpwalk - basic walk v1
   desc: |
     Execute an SNMP walk using version 1 protocol. 
     Use this command for legacy devices that do not support the newer v2c or v3 features. 
     While less efficient than v2c, it is often successful on older industrial or networking hardware during reconnaissance.
   command: "snmpwalk -v 1 -c {{community|public}} {{target}}"

 - title: snmpwalk - numerical OIDs
   desc: |
     Display the output using numerical OIDs instead of translating them to human-readable names. 
     This is useful when the local system lacks the necessary MIB files to translate the data. 
     It provides a raw look at the data structure, which is essential for scripting or manual OID analysis.
   command: "snmpwalk -v 2c -c {{community|public}} -n {{target}}"

# === SNMP VERSION 3 (AUTHENTICATED) ===

 - title: snmpwalk - v3 authentication without privacy
   desc: |
     Query a target using SNMPv3 with the authNoPriv security level. 
     This level provides identity verification through a username and an authentication passphrase but does not encrypt the data. 
     It is typically used in environments that require user accountability without the CPU overhead of full encryption.
   command: "snmpwalk -v 3 -l authNoPriv -u {{username}} -a {{auth_proto|SHA}} -A {{auth_passphrase}} {{target}}"

 - title: snmpwalk - v3 authentication and privacy
   desc: |
     Query a target using the highest security level (authPriv) available in SNMPv3. 
     This ensures that the SNMP traffic is protected against both spoofing and eavesdropping by using both authentication and encryption. 
     You must specify the authentication protocol (MD5/SHA) and the privacy protocol (DES/AES) along with their respective passwords.
   command: "snmpwalk -v 3 -l authPriv -u {{username}} -a {{auth_proto|SHA}} -A {{auth_passphrase}} -x {{priv_proto|AES}} -X {{priv_passphrase}} {{target}}"

# === TARGETED QUERIES AND MIB HANDLING ===

 - title: snmpwalk - walk specific OID
   desc: |
     Start the SNMP walk from a specific OID branch instead of the entire tree. 
     This is highly efficient when you are only interested in a specific category of data, such as interface statistics or process lists. 
     It reduces the time taken to complete the walk and minimizes unnecessary network traffic to the target agent.
   command: "snmpwalk -v 2c -c {{community|public}} {{target}} {{oid}}"

 - title: snmpwalk - load all MIBs
   desc: |
     Force the tool to load all available MIB files stored in the system directories during the walk. 
     This ensures that the output contains human-readable labels for as many objects as possible. 
     Use this when the standard output contains too many numerical strings that are difficult to interpret manually.
   command: "snmpwalk -v 2c -c {{community|public}} -m ALL {{target}}"

 - title: snmpwalk - enumerate system information
   desc: |
     Specifically target the system MIB group (OID 1.3.6.1.2.1.1) to gather basic host details. 
     The resulting output usually includes the device description, system uptime, administrator contact, and the hostname. 
     This is a standard first step in fingerprinting an unknown network device via SNMP.
   command: "snmpwalk -v 2c -c {{community|public}} {{target}} 1.3.6.1.2.1.1"

# === OUTPUT FORMATTING ===

 - title: snmpwalk - quick print format
   desc: |
     Format the output for easier parsing by removing unnecessary information from the display. 
     Using the -Oq flag strips away the OID type and other metadata, leaving a cleaner 'OID = value' format. 
     This is particularly helpful when you intend to pipe the output into other command-line tools like grep, awk, or sed.
   command: "snmpwalk -v 2c -c {{community|public}} -Oq {{target}}"

 - title: snmpwalk - hexadecimal string output
   desc: |
     Force all string values to be displayed in hexadecimal format. 
     This is useful when the agent returns non-printable characters or data that is misinterpreted as standard ASCII. 
     It is often used when debugging custom MIBs or examining binary data embedded in SNMP strings.
   command: "snmpwalk -v 2c -c {{community|public}} -Ox {{target}}"
