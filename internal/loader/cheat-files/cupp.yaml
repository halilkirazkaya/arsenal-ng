actions:
  # === CORE PROFILING ===
  - title: cupp - interactive password profiling
    desc: |
      Starts an interactive session to generate a personalized wordlist based on a target's specific details. 
      The tool will prompt for the target's name, nickname, birthdate, partner's info, and even pet names. 
      This is the most effective way to use the tool when performing social engineering-driven password attacks. 
      It creates a highly relevant list of potential passwords that humans are likely to choose.
    command: "cupp -i"

  - title: cupp - improve existing wordlist
    desc: |
      Uses an existing wordlist or dictionary file as a seed to generate new password variations. 
      This option is useful when you have a list of keywords related to a target and want to apply typical password complexity patterns to them. 
      The tool processes the input file and generates a much larger "pwnsauce" dictionary. 
      Ensure the input file is in a readable text format for the best results.
    command: "cupp -w {{input_file|dictionary.txt}}"

  # === DATABASE AND REPOSITORY ===
  - title: cupp - parse alecto default credentials
    desc: |
      Parses default usernames and passwords directly from the Alecto Database integration. 
      The Alecto DB merges and enhances purified databases from Phenoelit and CIRT projects. 
      This is extremely useful for identifying default vendor credentials on network equipment, IoT devices, or legacy systems. 
      It saves time by providing a consolidated list of known default access points.
    command: "cupp -a"

  - title: cupp - download wordlist repository
    desc: |
      Downloads a collection of large wordlists directly from the official CUPP repository. 
      These lists are categorized and can be used for general-purpose brute-forcing or as a base for further profiling. 
      Note that this action requires an active internet connection to reach the remote repository. 
      It is a quick way to populate your local toolset with standard password lists.
    command: "cupp -l"

  # === MISCELLANEOUS ===
  - title: cupp - show help menu
    desc: |
      Displays the help menu containing all available command-line arguments and options. 
      This is the quickest way to verify the installed version and see the correct syntax for various flags. 
      Use this whenever you are unsure about the specific parameter requirements for a command. 
      The output provides a brief overview of interactive, database, and wordlist options.
    command: "cupp -h"

  - title: cupp - display version information
    desc: |
      Shows the current version of the CUPP tool installed on the system. 
      Checking the version is important for ensuring compatibility with different Python environments and features. 
      Newer versions may include updated logic for password generation or better integration with databases. 
      This command is non-intrusive and does not perform any profiling or network activity.
    command: "cupp -v"
