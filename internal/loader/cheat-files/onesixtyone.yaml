  # === BASIC SCANNING ===
  - title: onesixtyone - basic single target scan
    desc: |
      Performs a simple SNMP scan against a single IP address using a specific community string.
      This command is primarily used to verify if a device responds to standard SNMP requests by fetching the sysDescr OID.
      It is an essential first step in network reconnaissance to identify the hardware and OS version of a target.
      By default, it uses the community string provided in the command line (e.g., public).
    command: "onesixtyone {{target}} {{community|public}}"

  - title: onesixtyone - scan a network range
    desc: |
      Scans an entire CIDR network range to discover active SNMP-enabled devices.
      This is highly efficient for large-scale discovery because the tool sends requests asynchronously.
      The output will list all responding IP addresses along with their system descriptions.
      It is particularly useful during internal penetration tests to map out infrastructure quickly.
    command: "onesixtyone {{network_range|192.168.1.0/24}} {{community|public}}"

  # === ENUMERATION & BRUTE FORCE ===
  - title: onesixtyone - community string brute force
    desc: |
      Attempts to find valid SNMP community strings by using a dictionary file against a target.
      Since many administrators change default strings for security, using a wordlist is crucial for discovery.
      The tool iterates through the file and reports any successful "handshakes" that return data.
      Note that while SNMP v1/v2c doesn't usually have lockout policies, high-frequency attempts might be logged by IDS.
    command: "onesixtyone -c {{wordlist|/usr/share/doc/onesixtyone/dict.txt}} {{target}}"

  - title: onesixtyone - multi-target scan from file
    desc: |
      Reads a list of target IP addresses or network ranges from an input file and scans them.
      This allows for more organized testing when you have a pre-filtered list of hosts from other tools like Nmap.
      You can combine this with a community wordlist to perform mass enumeration across different segments.
      It is an efficient way to automate the discovery process across multiple disparate targets.
    command: "onesixtyone -i {{input_file}} -c {{wordlist|dict.txt}}"

  # === ADVANCED CONFIGURATION ===
  - title: onesixtyone - adjust packet delay for stealth or stability
    desc: |
      Sets the waiting interval in milliseconds between sending packets to the target(s).
      Increasing the delay (default is 10ms) can help bypass simple rate-limiting or prevent network congestion.
      It is recommended to use a higher value like 100ms when scanning sensitive industrial control systems (ICS).
      Slower scans are also less likely to trigger high-load alerts on older networking hardware.
    command: "onesixtyone -w {{delay|100}} -i {{input_file}} -c {{wordlist}}"

  - title: onesixtyone - scan on a custom snmp port
    desc: |
      Targets a non-standard port for SNMP discovery instead of the default UDP port 161.
      Administrators occasionally move SNMP to different ports to avoid automated discovery and basic scans.
      This command is useful when initial scans fail but you suspect an SNMP service is hidden elsewhere.
      Ensure your firewall rules allow outgoing traffic on the specified custom port.
    command: "onesixtyone -p {{port|16161}} {{target}} {{community|public}}"

  # === OUTPUT MANAGEMENT ===
  - title: onesixtyone - log results to a file
    desc: |
      Saves the scan results to a specified output file for later analysis and documentation.
      This is vital for professional engagements where you must provide proof of discovery and findings.
      The tool will log the IP address, the community string that worked, and the system description.
      Using this with the quiet mode (-q) is common when you only want the file as a record without terminal clutter.
    command: "onesixtyone -o {{output_file|results.log}} {{target}} {{community|public}}"

  - title: onesixtyone - short output mode
    desc: |
      Displays only the IP addresses of the responding hosts without the full system description.
      This "short mode" is perfect for piping the output into other command-line tools or scripts.
      It allows for quick extraction of "live" SNMP targets for further processing with tools like snmp-check or snmpwalk.
      It simplifies the terminal view when scanning very large network ranges.
    command: "onesixtyone -s {{target}} {{community|public}}"

  - title: onesixtyone - debug and verbose mode
    desc: |
      Enables debug mode to provide more information about the packets being sent and received.
      Using the flag twice (-d -d) increases the verbosity further, showing detailed packet processing.
      This is primarily used for troubleshooting connectivity issues or verifying if the tool is working correctly.
      It can help identify why certain hosts are not responding even if they appear to be up.
    command: "onesixtyone -d {{target}} {{community|public}}"
